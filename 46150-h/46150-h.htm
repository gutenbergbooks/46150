<h1>FAMOUS DAYS IN THE CENTURY OF INVENTION</h1>




<h2><a name="HOW_THE_SEWING_MACHINE" id="HOW_THE_SEWING_MACHINE">HOW THE SEWING MACHINE
WON FAVOR</a></h2>


<h3>PART I</h3>


<p>"It is! It is!" chattered the robins at half past
three on an early June morning in 1845. Jonathan
Wheeler sat up in bed with a start. This was the
morning he had been waiting for all the spring,
the morning he was to start for Boston with his
father, mother, and Uncle William, and ride for
the first time on a railway train.</p>

<p>"Is it really pleasant?" was his first thought.
"It is! It is!" chirped the robins again. And
Jonathan's eyes by this time were open enough
to see the red glow through the eastern window.
In a second he was out of bed, hurrying into his
best clothes that his mother had laid out for him
the night before.</p>

<p>Jonathan lived in a little town only thirty miles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>from Boston; but traveling was not then the easy
and familiar experience of to-day. The nearest
railway station was at South Acton, fifteen miles
away. The Wheelers had planned to start from
home in the early morning, and after dining with
some friends in the railroad town, leave there for
Boston on the afternoon train.</p>

<p>But in those days the Fitchburg railroad had
not crossed the river, and had its terminal at
Charlestown. From there passengers were carried
by stage to the City Tavern in Brattle Street. It
would be six o'clock that night before Jonathan
could possibly see Boston.</p>

<p>But he lost no moment of his longed-for day.
The bothersome dressing and eating were soon over;
and Jonathan felt that his new experiences were
really beginning when, at seven o'clock, from the
front seat beside his father in the blue wagon, he
looked down on his eight less fortunate brothers
and sisters and several neighbors' children, who,
with the hired man, were waiting to see the travelers
depart.</p>

<p>"Good-bye! Good-bye, everybody!" called Jonathan,
proudly. "I shan't see you for three days,
and then I shall be wearing some store clothes!"</p>

<p>For the first few miles the conversation of his
elders did not interest him much. He was so busy
watching for the first signs of a railway train that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>the smoke from every far-away chimney attracted
his attention; but after a while, when there was
nothing to see but the thick growths of birch and
maple each side the road, he heard his father saying:</p>

<p>"Well, Betsey, I think thee has earned this
holiday. Thee has had a busy spring."</p>




<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/003.jpg">
<img src="images/003_th.jpg" alt="An Old-fashioned Train of Cars" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>An Old-fashioned Train of Cars</small></span></p></div>
</div>



<p>"It has been a busy time," agreed Mrs. Wheeler.
"But all the house-cleaning is done and every
stitch of the spring sewing. Since April I've cut
and made sixteen dresses and six suits of clothes."</p>

<p>"Did thee read in the Worcester <i>Spy</i> last week,
Betsey," inquired Uncle William, "of a sewing
machine that bids fair to be a success?"</p>

<p>"A sewing machine!" echoed Mrs. Wheeler.
"Does thee mean a machine that actually sews as
a woman sews? That's too good to be true!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>
<p>"But it's bound to come, Betsey," said her husband
reassuringly. "We're keeping house to-day
much as the early settlers did. We've found better
ways of travel, and labor-saving inventions are the
next thing." Then, turning to his brother, he
added, "Tell us, William, what the <i>Spy</i> said."</p>

<p>"Well, it seems there's a young man in Boston
who has a good deal of ingenuity, and he actually
has a sewing machine on exhibition at a tailor's
there. For some days he's been sewing seams with
it, the paper said, at the rate of three hundred
stitches to the minute. Perhaps we shall find that
tailor's shop to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I should like nothing better," answered Mrs.
Wheeler. "Maybe we can buy Jonathan's trousers
there."</p>

<p>Jonathan had been an interested listener to this
conversation; but just then he caught sight of a
moving column of smoke, and for the rest of the
drive he thought of little else but the engine he
could scarcely wait to see. By ten o'clock came
South Acton; then the long hours while his elders
ate slowly and talked much; at last the wonderful,
puffing, noisy engine and the strange, flat-roofed
houses on wheels with their many little
windows. Jonathan's world had grown very large
indeed when he went to sleep that night at the
City Tavern in Brattle Street.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>
<p>The next morning at the breakfast table, with
the aid of the <i>Morning Advertiser</i> and the Boston
<i>Transcript</i> of the night before, the Wheelers made
their plans for the day's shopping and sight-seeing.</p>

<p>"We'll do the shopping first," decided Mrs.
Wheeler. "Here's an advertisement of ready-made
clothing." And she read aloud what was, for those
days, a rather startling advertisement, beginning:</p>

<p class="center">
PERPETUAL FAIR<br />
<small>AT</small><br />
QUINCY HALL<br />
<small>OVER QUINCY HALL MARKET</small><br />
<small>BOSTON</small><br />
</p>

<p>"Let's go there," advised Uncle William. "Quincy
Market isn't far from here." So the Wheelers'
first stopping place that morning was Mr. Simmons's
establishment at Quincy Market.</p>

<p>"Has thee any linen trousers for this little boy
to wear with the dark blue jacket he has on?"
inquired Mrs. Wheeler of the young man who came
forward to serve them.</p>

<p>"We have, madam, I am sure." And deftly the
polite young man picked out a pair of dark blue
and white striped linen trousers from the middle of
a neat pile of garments. Sure enough, the trousers
were of the right size; and, to the Wheelers' astonishment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>the price was less than they had expected
to pay.</p>

<p>"There must be some profit, madam, you see,"
explained the clerk; "but if we could make these
garments by machine, as a young man in the next
room says he can, we
could afford to sell them
for almost nothing."</p>

<p>"We have heard of
that young man and
his machine. Will it be
possible for us to watch
him sew with it?" replied
Mrs. Wheeler.</p>



<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/006.jpg">
<img src="images/006_th.jpg" alt="Howe's First Sewing Machine" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>Howe's First Sewing Machine</small></span></p></div>
</div>



<p>"Certainly, madam.
Just step this way, if
you please." And he
ushered the Wheelers into
an adjoining workshop, well filled with men and
women, many of the men, as Jonathan found out
later, being dealers in ready-made clothing in the
larger towns near Boston.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, there he is!" whispered Jonathan
excitedly, and he hurried forward to see better.</p>

<p>A kindly-faced young man, not more than twenty-five
years old, sat at a table before what seemed to
Jonathan a sort of little engine without wheels.
With one hand he was turning a crank and with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>other he was guiding a seam on a pair of overalls.
A bright needle flashed in and out of the blue
cloth till it reached the end of the seam. Then
the sewer stopped the machine, cut the thread,
and handed the garment about for inspection.</p>

<p>"That took just one minute, Mr. Howe," announced
a man who stood near, watch in hand.</p>

<p>"One minute!" echoed a woman standing beside
Jonathan. "I could not sew that seam in
fifteen minutes."</p>

<p>"How long would it take thee, mother?" whispered
Jonathan, aside.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure, little boy," his mother whispered
back. "I think I could do it in ten minutes."</p>

<p>"An experienced seamstress could not sew that
seam in less than five minutes," then spoke Mr.
Howe, as if in answer to a question.</p>

<p>"I don't quite believe that," objected one man.</p>

<p>"Well, why not have a race?" challenged Mr.
Howe. "Mr. Simmons," he continued, addressing
the proprietor, "will you let five of your best
sewers run a race with me? I'll take five seams to
sew while each of them does one. Are you
willing?"</p>

<p>"Agreed!" said Mr. Simmons. And it was but
the work of a moment to select an umpire and prepare
the seams. Then the umpire gave the command
to start and the race began.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>
<p>It was an exciting contest. The girls sewed "as
fast as they could, much faster than they were in
the habit of sewing." Mr. Howe worked steadily
but carefully.</p>

<p>"If he wins, how many times as fast as each
girl is he sewing?" asked Jonathan's uncle suddenly,
of the little fellow. Jonathan was too bright
to be caught and answered quickly, "More than
five, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"That's right, Jonathan. And he really is sewing
more than five times as fast. Look!"</p>

<p>It was true. Mr. Howe held up his finished
seam. Every girl was still at work. "The machine
has beaten," announced the umpire. "And moreover,"
he added after careful inspection, "the work
on the machine is the neatest and strongest."</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen," said Mr. Howe, "may I
not have your orders for a sewing machine? See
what a money-saver it will be! I can make you one
for seven hundred dollars. It will pay for itself
in a few months, and it will last for years."</p>

<p>Jonathan expected to hear many of the tailors
present order a machine at once. But he was witnessing,
although he did not know it till years
afterward, "the pain that usually accompanies a
new idea." The invention which was to make the
greatest change of the century in the manufacturing
world lay for several years unused and scorned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>by the public. The short-sighted tailors over
Quincy Hall Market made one objection after another.</p>

<p>"It does not make the whole garment."</p>

<p>"My journeymen would be furious."</p>

<p>"Truly, it would beggar all handsewers."</p>




<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/009.jpg">
<img src="images/009_th.jpg" alt="Faneuil Hall, Boston" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>Faneuil Hall, Boston, Adjoining Quincy Market</small></span><br />
<small>"The Cradle of Liberty."</small></p></div>
</div>




<p>"We are doing well enough as we are."</p>

<p>"It costs too much."</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Howe, I should need ten machines.
I should never get my money back."</p>

<p>Jonathan was sorry for Mr. Howe. "I'll buy a
machine some day," he announced.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>
<p>"Thank you, little boy," answered Mr. Howe.
"I've no doubt you will."</p>

<p>But the tailors laughed and shook their heads.</p>

<p>Before they left the workshop, Jonathan's party
had a long talk with Mr. Howe.</p>

<p>"We are from the country," they said, "with
no money to buy a machine of this sort. But we
are interested in it, and we believe it has a future.
Will thee tell us more about it?"</p>

<p>"Gladly," said Mr. Howe. "I've been at work
on the machine most of the time for the last five
years&mdash;ever since I was twenty-one, in fact. I
was born up in Worcester County, in Spencer.
When I was eleven, I was bound out to a farmer,
but I liked machinery better. I went to Lowell
as soon as my parents were willing, and worked a
while in a cotton mill. But I did not like that very
well, it was so monotonous, and I came down here
to work for Mr. Davis in Cornhill. One day a
man who was trying to construct a knitting machine
came in to see if Mr. Davis could make him
a suggestion. But Davis really made the suggestion
to me. 'Why don't you make a sewing machine?'
he asked.</p>

<p>"'I wish I could,' the man answered, 'but it
can't be done.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, yes,' cried Davis, 'I could make one
myself.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>
<p>"'Well,' was the rejoinder, 'you do it, Davis,
and I'll insure you an independent fortune.'</p>






<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/011.jpg">
<img src="images/011_th.jpg" alt="Lock Stitch" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>Lock Stitch</small></span><small> (above)</small> <span class="smcap"><small>and Chain
Stitch</small></span><small> (below)</small> <br />

<small>The lock stitch is made with two threads, and
the chain stitch with one.</small></p></div>
</div>



<p>"Now I don't know that Davis or the other
man has thought of the matter since. As for me,
I've thought of little
else. A year ago last
October I had planned
out the chief parts of
the machine&mdash;the two
threads, the curved,
eye-pointed needle,
and the shuttle. A
rough model that I
made convinced me that such a machine would
work; and last December I prevailed upon my
friend, Mr. Fisher of Cambridgeport, to let me,
with my wife and children, live at his house and
construct my machine in his garret. He gave me
five hundred dollars besides for material. In return
for those favors, I've agreed to give Fisher
half my profits. But," he added rather gloomily,
"so far it's been a bad bargain for Fisher."</p>

<p>"Is the machine patented?" inquired Uncle
William.</p>

<p>"Not yet," answered Mr. Howe. "I need some
money first, for, you know, I shall have to make a
model to deposit at Washington."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>The Wheelers thanked Mr. Howe for his kindness
in satisfying their curiosity and wished him all
good fortune.</p>

<p>"Sometime," added Jonathan's father, "I expect
thy machine will find its way into homes as
well as into shops."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Mr. Howe," added Mrs. Wheeler,
"it would be the greatest boon the farmer's wife
could ask."</p>

<p>"I prophesy, Betsey," said Uncle William,
"that before many years thee will make Jonathan
some overalls with a machine of thine own.
Meantime," turning to Mr. Howe, "I want to
buy him the pair thee sewed in the race. They
were boys' trousers, were they not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Mr. Howe, "and I'm sure Mr.
Simmons will be glad to sell them to you. He
does not put too high a value on them, you know,"
he added soberly. "Anyway, I shall be glad to
know that my machine has sewed for so engaging
a little fellow," he finished, with a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>As for Jonathan, he was almost too excited to
speak. Two new pairs of "store" trousers in one
day, and one of these sewed by a machine! "Thank
you, Uncle William," he gasped. And he must say
something to Mr. Howe. "Thank you, too, Mr.
Howe. I shall surely buy a machine some day."</p>

<p>Jonathan returned to the country the next day,
a much traveled little boy for the year 1845. All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>his experiences remained vividly in his memory:
the wonderful railway train, the stage coach clattering
over the city pavements, the waiter at the
hotel who stood politely near the table and anticipated
his wants&mdash;all these recollections made
his farm life happier and his farm tasks easier.
Of all his Boston memories, however, none were
more vivid or more persistent than the sight of
that marvelous sewing machine and its exciting
race with the skilled sewers.</p>

<p>"What has become of Mr. Howe?" thought
Jonathan more than once. "Has he given up trying
to persuade people that sewing by hand was
often a needless drudgery?" For a year and a half
Jonathan could only wonder. Then, one day in
February, 1847, Uncle William read in the Boston
<i>Advertiser</i> that Elias Howe and his brother had
taken passage in a packet for England to interest
Londoners in the curious machine that could work
faster and more skillfully than human fingers.</p>


<h3>PART II</h3>

<p>Three years later Uncle William took Jonathan
on another journey, this time to a small town west
of Worcester and about thirty miles from home.
The trip was made, so Uncle William said, to consult
with a county commissioner there about the
prospect of a much needed road; but Mrs. Wheeler,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>when she remembered that Mr. Howe had mentioned
Spencer as his birthplace, remarked knowingly
to her husband:</p>

<p>"Not that I would question Brother William's
motive, but thee knows, Daniel, that he was the
most interested man in that room over the Quincy
Hall Market. He may need to see the commissioner,
but I think he's more interested in the fortunes
of young Howe."</p>




<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/014.jpg">
<img src="images/014_th.jpg" alt="Jonathan and his Uncle William" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>Jonathan and his Uncle William in the One-horse Chaise</small></span></p></div>
</div>




<p>"I believe thee's right," answered her husband.
"And I hope," he added, "that William will come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>back with good news about that young fellow and
his machine."</p>

<p>There was no railway train this time for Jonathan.
It was an interesting journey, nevertheless,
through a beautiful hill country with varied scenery.
Jonathan and his uncle both enjoyed their
ride in the comfortable one-horse chaise and their
dinner at the Worcester inn. In the afternoon they
drove out to Spencer and put up at the tavern
there; and after supper they went to bed in the
very room where President Washington once had
slept.</p>

<p>"Now, if I could only see Mr. Howe on the street
to-morrow morning!" thought Jonathan as he
dropped asleep.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wheeler would not have been greatly surprised
at Uncle William's procedure the next morning.
The visit to the county commissioner was
made immediately after breakfast and the information
that Uncle William desired easily and
quickly obtained.</p>

<p>"By the way," inquired Uncle William when
the business interview was over, "do you know
anything of a young fellow named Elias Howe?"</p>

<p>"Elias Howe? Why, yes, I believe so. There are
so many Howes here I had to think a minute.
You mean Elias, Jr., I guess. They did live down
in the south part. The young fellow had some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>scheme of sewing by machinery. Couldn't make
it work, I believe."</p>

<p>"Is his father living here?"</p>

<p>"No, not now. Another son invented a machine
for cutting palm leaf into strips for hats and Howe
moved to Cambridge to help the thing along. Don't
believe he'll ever come back."</p>

<p>"My nephew and I saw young Howe in Boston
four years ago with his sewing machine. We've
both been much interested to hear more about
his fortunes. Has he some relatives here who
could tell us?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, his uncle Tyler lives here, his father's
brother. His house is right over there. Better
call on him. He's a pleasant fellow&mdash;every Howe
is&mdash;and he likes to talk."</p>

<p>"Shall we?" asked Uncle William of Jonathan.</p>

<p>Jonathan's feeling in the matter was not uncertain,
but all he said was, "I should like to, Uncle."</p>

<p>"Glad to see you both," was the hearty greeting
of Mr. Tyler Howe, upon hearing Uncle William's
introduction of himself and his nephew. "Well,
Elias is a smart boy and a good one, but he's pretty
well down on his luck just now. So you saw him
in Boston? Four years ago, wasn't it? Since then
he's had a discouraging time.</p>

<p>"After he exhibited his machine in the shop
where you saw him, he spent three or four months
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>in Fisher's garret, making another machine to deposit
in the patent office. The next year he and
Fisher went to Washington, where they had no
trouble in getting a patent, but no luck at all in
interesting people in the sewing machine. They
exhibited it once at a fair, but the crowd was
amused, that's all.</p>

<p>"By the time Fisher got back to Cambridge, he
washed his hands of the whole matter. I don't
much wonder. He'd spent all of two thousand
dollars and hadn't had a cent in return. Then
Elias had only his family to turn to. With his
wife and children he moved to his father's and began
to plan how to interest England in the invention
America had rejected.</p>

<p>"He made a third machine, and with that as a
sample, his brother Amasa sailed for England in
October, about a month after Elias came back from
Washington. For a time it seemed as if the trip
would be worth while. Amasa showed the machine
to a William Thomas, who had a shop in Cheapside,
where he manufactured corsets, umbrellas, carpet
bags, and shoes. You can see that the sewing of
such articles must be extremely difficult, and
Thomas was really interested in the machine.</p>

<p>"But Amasa, I'm afraid, hasn't proved himself
much of a business man. He sold Mr. Thomas outright
for two hundred fifty pounds sterling (that's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>twelve hundred fifty dollars of our money, Jonathan)
the machine he had brought with him and the
right to use as many more as were necessary in the
business."</p>

<p>"Then the notice in the paper was a mistake.
So Elias didn't go to Europe?" inquired Uncle
William.</p>




<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/018.jpg">
<img src="images/018_th.jpg" alt="Cheapside in London" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>Cheapside in London</small></span></p></div>
</div>





<p>"Yes, the notice was true. You see, the man
Thomas did most of his trade in corsets, and the
machine was better adapted to sewing overalls
and shirts. So Thomas agreed to give Elias three
pounds a week if he would go over to London and
adapt the machine for use on corsets and other
stiff material. Thomas also agreed to pay the expenses
of workshop, tools, and material.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>
<p>"Amasa came back to America with this news,
and then he and Elias, with the precious first machine,
started together for London in February,
just as the paper said. They had so little money
that they had to go in the steerage and cook their
own food. But in London things went well for a
time, and Thomas even advanced the money for
Elias's family to join him. However, the good
fortune was short-lived. In eight months Elias
had adapted his machine to Thomas's requirements,
and then Thomas ungratefully discharged him for
good and all.</p>

<p>"Things were pretty dark for Elias by this time.
Thomas had agreed, but only by word of mouth,
to patent the invention in England, and to pay
Elias three pounds on every machine that was
sold. There are scoundrels everywhere, I suppose;
but that Thomas has proved one of the meanest
men I ever heard of. Sewing machines are fairly
common in London now, and on every one of those
Thomas has realized about ten pounds, but Elias
hasn't had a shilling.</p>

<p>"Of course, when Thomas discharged him, he
had nothing to do but move his family into cheaper
quarters, borrow a few tools, and begin the construction
of a fourth machine. He could not finish
it without more money, so he moved his family
into one very small room and worked as fast as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>could. But even then he could not buy food for
his wife and children and material for his machine.
There was nothing to do but send his family
home and work at the machine till he could sell it
and get his own passage money.</p>

<p>"Elias has been in a good many straits for a
young fellow, but he has a marked gift for making
friends. At this time he grew to know pretty well
a coach maker, named Charles Inglis, who unfortunately
was a poor man too, but who often lent
him what money he could during those evil days,
and what was better, kept faith in him.</p>

<p>"The night that Mrs. Howe and the children
left England, it was so very wet and stormy that
Mrs. Howe, who was almost in consumption, could
not walk to the ship. Inglis lent Elias a few shillings
for the cab hire, and Elias promised him some
clothing in return. The clothing was what the
washerwoman had brought home that morning,
but had taken away again, because there was no
money to pay her.</p>

<p>"Then came days of pinching poverty for Elias;
but not quite such unhappy ones, I think, now that
the wife and children were soon to be with the relatives
in Cambridge. Elias knew that the Howes
were too proud to let his family starve; and as for
himself, he would borrow a shilling at a time of
Inglis and buy beans to cook in his own room.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>
<p>"Finally he finished the machine. Instead of
getting the fifty pounds that it was worth, he had
to sell it for five pounds, and even then for a mere
promise to pay. Inglis soon managed to get four
pounds of the money in cash for him, but that
four pounds was by no means enough to pay
Elias's debts and buy his passage. There was
nothing to do but pawn
his precious first machine
and the letters-patent.
That done, he drew his
baggage on a hand cart
to a freight vessel, and
he and Inglis took passage
in the steerage of
another ship bound for
America.</p>

<p>"Elias reached New
York last April with half
a crown in his pocket, but
he found employment in a machine shop almost at
once. Then came the sad news that his wife, who
had been ill when she left England, was dying in
Cambridge.</p>





<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/021.jpg">
<img src="images/021_th.jpg" alt="Howe's Improved Sewing Machine" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>Howe's Improved Sewing
Machine</small></span></p></div>
</div>



<p>"Elias had no money for a railroad journey.
He had to wait friendless, except for Inglis, in a great
city, wholly despairing of ever seeing his wife again
and feeling that he had risked everything to gain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>nothing. His father, however, as soon as he knew
of his destitution, sent him ten dollars, and Elias
reached Cambridge just in time to speak to his
wife before she died. He had no clothes, though,
but his shabby working suit, and could not have
gone to the funeral if his brother had not lent him
a coat.</p>

<p>"That was the last time I saw Elias, and then I
should scarcely have known him. By nature, he
is, you know, a pleasant-faced, happy fellow; but
then he looked as if he had had a long, painful
sickness. There wasn't a trace of his old self left.
And as if he hadn't had trouble enough, word
arrived before I left Cambridge that the vessel
to which he had carted his household goods had
been wrecked off Cape Cod.</p>

<p>"Most people would have given up, I think,
under all these trials, but Elias has a good deal of
the Howe perseverance. He immediately got a
position in Boston as a journeyman machinist at
weekly wages."</p>

<p>"And where is he now?" inquired Uncle William
sympathetically.</p>

<p>"I had a letter from him the other day. Should
you like to hear it?"</p>

<p>Taking the answer for granted, Mr. Howe opened
his desk and took out the letter. Then he read as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>


<blockquote>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Cambridge, Mass.</span>, <i>June 20, 1849</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>My dear Uncle,</i><br />
</p>

<p>You will be interested, I know, in what I have
to write; and I think you will agree with me that
I shall yet retrieve all my ill-luck. Any advice
you may have for me I shall cheerfully receive.</p>

<p>First look at the enclosed hand bill.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>And Mr. Howe interrupted the reading to pass
Uncle William and Jonathan a small hand bill
like this:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
A GREAT<br />
CURIOSITY!!<br />
THE<br />
YANKEE SEWING MACHINE<br />
<small>IS NOW</small><br />
EXHIBITING<br />
<small>AT THIS PLACE</small><br />
<small>FROM</small><br />
<small>8 </small><span class="smcap"><small>A.M.</small></span><small> TO 5 </small><span class="smcap"><small>P.M.</small></span><br />
</p>

<p>He then went on with the reading:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That was posted about in Ithaca, N. Y., just a
few weeks after I came back from England.</p>

<p>Some fellow made a machine from the description
he heard of mine, and he has been giving
exhibitions of its work in various places.
He says his machine can do the work of six
hands and make a pair of pantaloons in forty
minutes. And I have no doubt he tells the
truth.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>
<p>Only, Uncle Tyler, don't you see it's <i>my</i> machine
and he is infringing on <i>my</i> patent? And
more than that, right here in Boston machines
have been built on my model and are in daily
use. Now I know that I am without resources
and that I have pretty well exhausted the patience
of my friends. But surely my claims are
valid.</p>

<p>Getting money to push them is the task I
dread. Still I have already raised a hundred
dollars to get my machine and letters patent
out of pawn in London; and I have every hope
that Mr. Anson Burlingame, who is soon to sail
for England, will deliver them safely to me in
the fall.</p>

<p>The next step is to see if the lawyers can find
any flaws in my claims. If they can't, the suit
I propose to bring is already in my favor; and
I am sanguine enough to believe that the Howe
sewing machine will yet be a household convenience.</p>

<p class="right">
Yours respectfully,<br />
<span class="smcap">Elias Howe</span>, Jr.<br />
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"Well," commented Mr. Howe, as he folded the
letter slowly, "I didn't know how to answer that.
He said he wanted advice. I know he wants money
more, but of course he hates to ask for it. I deliberated
a good while; but finally I wrote him that
if the lawyers gave him assurance that his claims
were valid, I would advance what money I could
spare to further his suit."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<p>There was silence in the room for a little while.
Then Jonathan said earnestly:</p>

<p>"I wish I had some money to give Mr. Howe.
Would he take my five dollars, do you think?"
he asked of the inventor's uncle.</p>

<p>"See, I have it here; and I should be glad to give
it to him without waiting to hear what the lawyers
say. Do you think it would be all right to send it,
Mr. Howe?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"And may I, Uncle William?" he added quickly,
for he had almost taken his uncle's permission for
granted.</p>

<p>Uncle William nodded;
and Mr. Howe
said, "You may never
get it back, you know."</p>

<p>"I think I shall,"
answered Jonathan confidently.
"And anyway
I want to help Mr.
Howe."</p>

<p>"Do you want to
send it now?" inquired
Mr. Howe.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>Elias Howe</small></span></p></div>

<p>"If you please," replied
Jonathan.</p>

<p>"Then you may write your letter here, while
your uncle and I go for a walk."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>


<blockquote>


<p class="right">

<p><i>Mr. Elias Howe, Jr.,</i><br />

<p><i>My dear Mr. Howe</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>Perhaps thee remembers the boy who saw
thee run a race with thy sewing machine against
five seamstresses over Quincy Hall Market four
years ago. Thy uncle told me of the hard time
thee has had since. I am very sorry. I want
to buy a sewing machine and I want to help thee.
I am sending thee five dollars. It is all the
money I have. I hope thee will use it to win
thy suit. Sometime when thee sells sewing machines,
I hope thee will sell me one for my mother
five dollars less than the usual price. Thee can
see thee will not have to pay this back for a
long time, for it will be a good many years
before I shall have money enough to buy a
sewing machine.</p>

<p class="right">
Thy friend and well-wisher,<br />
<span class="smcap">Jonathan Wheeler</span><br />
</p>

</blockquote>


<p>There is little more to tell of Jonathan's visit to
Spencer. After dinner that day he started with
his uncle for Worcester, where they stayed all
night. The next morning, after an early breakfast,
they set out again, reaching home before the
forenoon grew very hot.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<h3>PART III</h3>

<p>Not many days after Jonathan's return, the first
letter he ever received his father brought him from
the post office. It hardly needed the post mark,
Cambridge, to make Jonathan sure who had sent
it. Let us open it with him:&mdash;</p>


<blockquote>


<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Cambridge</span>, <i>August 26, 1849.</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>My dear friend Jonathan,</i></p>

<p>Your letter with its inclosure of five dollars
has been gratefully received. I remember you
and your uncle, your father and your mother,
with much pleasure. Ever since I ran that race
in Boston I have been sure that the machine
would work its way to success.</p>

<p>I am more confident now than ever. I have
found some one who will buy out Mr. Fisher's
interest; Mr. Burlingame will bring my old machine
and letters patent from London; and every
lawyer I have consulted says my claims are valid
and I shall win my suit.</p>

<p>When I have succeeded, and the manufacture
of sewing machines is under my control, I shall
send for you to pick out a machine for your
mother.</p>

<p>Again thanking you for your substantial interest,
I am</p>

<p class="right">
Very faithfully yours,<br />
<span class="smcap">Elias Howe</span>, Jr.<br />
</p>

</blockquote>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
<p>This was in 1849. Mr. Howe's darkest days
were over; but even then success came slowly and
in rather a strange way. Mr. Howe's chief enemy
was a Mr. Singer, who built machines and advertised
them with remarkable success.</p>

<p>"You are infringing my patent," wrote Howe
to Singer, upon hearing of the latter's activity.</p>

<p>"But you are not the inventor," replied Singer.
"The Chinese have had a sewing machine for ages;
an Englishman made one in 1790; a Frenchman
built one in 1830; and what is more to the point,
in 1832, a man named Walter Hunt, living in New
York, invented a sewing machine with a shuttle
stitch like yours. I can find Walter Hunt and
prove my statement."</p>

<p>Well, Mr. Singer did find Walter Hunt and the
fragments of his old machine. But "not all the
king's horses nor all the king's men" could put
those fragments together again so that the machine
would sew. For four years, however, the trial in
the courts continued. But at last, in 1854, when
Mr. Howe had waited nine years after completing
his first machine, the Wheelers and many others
read with great satisfaction in the Worcester <i>Spy</i>:</p>


<blockquote>

<p>"Judge Sprague of Massachusetts has decided
that the plaintiff's patent is valid and that the defendant's
machine is an infringement. Further,
there is no evidence in this case that leaves a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>shadow of a doubt that, for all the benefit conferred
upon the public by the introduction of a
sewing machine, the public are indebted to Mr.
Howe."</p>

</blockquote>


<p>In 1855, Jonathan, now grown into a tall, manly
youth of twenty, started with Uncle William on
another journey, longer and more interesting than
either had ever taken before. This time they went
to New York, where they found Mr. Howe at the
head of a prosperous business; and when they returned,
they brought with them a Howe sewing
machine of the very latest model, "a present from
the inventor to Mrs. Wheeler, in gratitude for the
sympathy and encouragement of her family."</p>

<h2><a name="LONG-DISTANCE_TALKING" id="LONG-DISTANCE_TALKING">LONG-DISTANCE TALKING</a></h2>


<h3>PART I</h3>

<p>Late one June afternoon Arthur Burton was
leaning against a table in the eastern gallery of the
main hall at the Philadelphia Exposition. It had
been a wonderful day, but it was past dinner time,
and he was hot, tired, and hungry. He had seen
more wonders that day than he had witnessed in
all his life before; but now his uncle and the other
judges were in the midst of the Massachusetts
educational exhibit, which wasn't half so interesting
as the first electric light, or the first grain
reaper, or the iceboats. So Arthur had moved
away from the new-fashioned school desks and the
slate blackboards, and was waiting rather wearily.</p>

<p>Suddenly he straightened up. Entering the door
near by was the most distinguished visitor at the
Centennial, the tall, handsome Dom Pedro, Emperor
of Brazil, with the Empress and a bevy of
courtiers. To Arthur's amazement, His Majesty
walked directly up to the table against which
he himself was standing; and looking beyond the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>little boy, he said with outstretched hand and a
pleasant smile:</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Bell? I am very glad to
see you and your work."</p>

<p>Till then Arthur had scarcely noticed a sallow,
dark-haired young man who had been sitting behind
the little
table, nor had he
paid the slightest
attention to some
pieces of wood
and iron with
wire attached
lying on the table.
But now, the
young man and
his material had
become decidedly
interesting.</p>



<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/031.jpg">
<img src="images/031_th.jpg" alt="Dom Pedro II" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>Dom Pedro II</small></span></p></div>
</div>




<p>"I remember
very pleasantly," continued Dom Pedro, "my
visit to your class in Boston University when
you were teaching deaf mutes to speak by means
of visible speech. You were working out a new
method, I remember. I suppose this is apparatus
that you have devised in that connection."</p>

<p>"I thank Your Majesty," stammered the surprised
young man, who for a moment had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>at a loss to recall who his royal visitor might be.
"I shall be delighted to explain my apparatus. But
it has nothing to do with teaching deaf mutes to
speak. It is more wonderful than that. It speaks
itself; that is, it reproduces sounds. It is the improvement
on the telegraph that the world has
awaited for years.</p>

<p>"You see, I found in my experiments that I
could transmit spoken words by electric current
through a telegraph wire so that those words could
be reproduced by vibrations at the other end
of the wire. I suppose my invention might be
called a speaking telegraph."</p>

<p>By this time all the judges had joined the Emperor's
party. Arthur fell back to his uncle's side,
but he could still hear and see everything.</p>

<p>"Now, Your Majesty," continued Mr. Bell,
"if you will press your ear against the lid of this iron
box, I think in a moment you will have a surprise."</p>

<p>At these words, Mr. Bell's assistant, who had
come up to the group during the conversation,
went to another table several rods away and quite
out of hearing. The Emperor bent down expectantly.
The judges looked rather incredulous, but
they were all interested.</p>

<p>"Is the man that went off going to talk over the
wire so that the Emperor can hear?" whispered
Arthur to his uncle.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<p>"Mr. Bell says so," was the reply, "but we shall
see."</p>

<p>Suddenly the Emperor gave a start, and a look
of utter amazement came over his face.</p>

<p>"It talks! It talks!" he exclaimed excitedly.</p>

<p>It was quite true. Mr. Hubbard, Mr. Bell's
assistant, had spoken in a low voice at the other
end of the wire and his exact words had been reproduced.
The Emperor's excitement was contagious.
Everybody forgot how hot and hungry
he was. One after another of the judges listened
at the magic box to hear Mr. Hubbard or another
of their number speak into the instrument at the
other end.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle, do you suppose I can listen too
after a while?" inquired Arthur, when he could no
longer keep still.</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Bell himself interposed.</p>

<p>"Now it must be the little boy's turn."</p>

<p>The grateful little boy was not slow in stooping
over to the receiver.</p>

<p>"What does he say, Arthur?" asked his uncle.</p>

<p>"Why, he says, 'To be or not to be,' whatever
that means."</p>

<p>"You don't know your Hamlet very well yet,
little boy."</p>

<p>"But I have heard a speaking telegraph, and that
is better," replied Arthur.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>
<p>By this time Mr. Hubbard was returning with
the apparatus he had been using at the other end.
It was time to see how the marvel had been wrought.</p>

<p>"Now tell us how it works, Mr. Bell," commanded
Dom Pedro.</p>

<p>"It is very simple," Mr. Bell explained. "You
know, of course, that for some years it has been
possible to transmit articulate speech through India
rubber tubes and stringed instruments for short
distances; but I worked, as you see, to transmit
spoken words by electric current through a telegraph
wire.</p>

<p>"Here on the table before you is the instrument
I call the transmitter, into which Mr. Hubbard
spoke. This projecting part is only a mouth-piece.
Inside is a piece of thin iron attached to a
membrane, and this piece of iron vibrates whenever
one speaks into the transmitter. For you know,
gentlemen, that if you hold a piece of paper in
front of your mouth and then sing or talk, the
paper will vibrate as many times as the air does.</p>

<p>"Now, of course, if I could reproduce those sound
or air waves at a distance, a person listening would
hear the same sounds that caused the first vibration.
I have accomplished that by making and
breaking an electric current between two pieces of
sheet iron. My assistant spoke into the cone-shaped
mouth-piece. At the end of it, as you could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>see if I took off the cover, is the first thin plate of
sheet iron. Near that iron, but not touching it,
is a magnetized piece of iron wound around with a
coil of wire.</p>




<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/035.jpg">
<img src="images/035_th.jpg" alt="Bell's Telephone" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>Bell's Telephone in March, 1876.</small></span></p></div>
</div>




<p>"This magnet is connected by this wire with another
magnet that also has a coil of wire around
it. On the other side of the second magnet is the
other thin plate of sheet iron. This last part makes
what I call the receiver. It is the part at which you
listened. It looks, you see, like a metallic pill box
with a flat disc for a cover, fastened down at one side
and tilted up on another. When you put your ear
to that, you heard the reproduction of the original
sound."</p>

<p>"Marvelous!" "Wonderful!" "Stupendous!"
"Incredible!" were some of the exclamations.</p>

<p>"But, gentlemen," confirmed one of the judges,
a man named Elisha Gray, "it is perfectly true. I
myself have an invention of a similar sort, by which
I can send musical sounds along a telegraph wire."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>
<p>There was a moment of amazement and congratulation
for Mr. Gray. Then came a question addressed
to Mr. Bell.</p>

<p>"Could you talk into the iron box and hear at
the transmitter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but not easily. So far I have had to use
different instruments at each end of the circuit. I
shall remedy that some day," continued Mr. Bell,
confidently.</p>

<p>"I am sure you will," agreed the questioner.
"We want to see this again, sir," spoke one of
the group. "May it not be transferred to the
Judges' Hall?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, as far as I am concerned," was the
reply. "Mr. Hubbard will see to that, I am sure.
I myself must return to Boston to-night."</p>

<p>"My young friend," now spoke Sir William
Thomson (who later became Lord Kelvin), perhaps
the most noted of all the scientists present, "is it
not possible to arrange for a test with your apparatus
over a considerable distance? If so, I shall be
glad to go to Boston also to witness such an experiment."</p>

<p>"I shall be most delighted, Sir William," answered
Bell. "I will make the necessary arrangements
and telegraph you at once."</p>

<p>After more congratulations for the young inventor,
the group dispersed, the judges going away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>to the dinner they had for a while forgotten. But
during the meal and through the evening they talked
of little but the new invention; and Arthur distinctly
remembers to this day the enthusiastic remark
of Sir William Thomson: "What yesterday
I should have declared impossible I have to-day
seen realized. The speaking telegraph is the most
wonderful thing I have seen in America."</p>


<h3>PART II</h3>

<p>When Arthur went back to his home in one of
the country towns of Massachusetts, he had many
things to tell his family and his friends. To him
the Exposition had been a veritable fairy land. But
the most wonderful genie there was Electricity,
and his most remarkable work was the speaking
telegraph.</p>

<p>"And you could really hear through that wire?"
questioned more than one incredulous person.</p>

<p>"I really could, and as plainly as I hear you,"
insisted Arthur.</p>

<p>"Sho, now!" remonstrated a farmer neighbor,
"you only thought you could."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe," commented another, cautiously,
"but of course there was a hole in the wire that
you didn't see."</p>

<p>Arthur's own family were more thoughtful and
intelligent people.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>
<p>"I knew," said Grandfather, "that the marvels
of electricity were not all understood. When I
was a young man, the telegraph was the greatest
wonder the world owned. But using that was somehow
like talking at arm's length; the telephone
brings your friend almost beside you."</p>

<p>"To me," said Arthur's mother, "the telephone,
in comparison with the telegraph, seems like a
highly finished oil painting. The old invention
is like a page of black and white print."</p>

<p>"Why, I have seen Mr. Bell," remembered
Arthur's older sister, who was studying to be a
teacher, after she had heard the story. "He came
to the normal school last year to explain his system
of teaching deaf mutes to speak."</p>

<p>The Burtons heard no more of the telephone
for six months or more; but the next winter, when
Herbert, the older brother, came home from Tufts
College to spend a week end, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Well, Arthur, I've talked through a telephone,
too!"</p>

<p>"You have!"</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Tell us about it!" were the quick replies.</p>

<p>"Professor Dolbear, the physics instructor, has
made one in his laboratory. It's a little different
from Professor Bell's. Your professor, Arthur,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>had a battery, you know, to make the electro-magnet.
My professor has a permanent magnet instead."</p>

<p>Early in February Herbert came home with
more news and an invitation: "Professor Bell is
going to give a public lecture and exhibition of his
telephone at Salem next Monday evening. He
expects to carry on a conversation with people in
Boston. Want to go back to college with me Monday
morning, Arthur, and go down to Salem in
the evening?"</p>

<p>So it happened that on Monday evening, February
12, 1877, Arthur and Herbert, with about
five hundred others, were at Lyceum Hall in Salem.
It was an eager audience, full of curiosity.</p>

<p>Upon the platform and well toward the front was
a small table, on the top of which rested an unimportant-looking
covered box. From this box wires
extended above to the gas fixture and out through
the hall. At the back of the platform was a blackboard
on a frame, and at the side a young woman,
an expert telegrapher, who was to help Mr. Bell.</p>

<p>"Rather an unpromising set of apparatus!"
Arthur heard a man behind him whisper to his
neighbor.</p>

<p>"I'm not expecting much," returned the neighbor.
"They say Professor Bell's going to talk to
Boston. That's nonsense!"</p>

<p>But just then Professor Bell began. He briefly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>explained the instrument upon the table, which,
Arthur saw, varied but little from that at Philadelphia.</p>

<p>"Only," thought Arthur, "he uses it now as he
said he should, for transmitting and receiving
too."</p>

<p>Then Professor Bell gave a brief account of the
studies he had made since 1872, when he came to
Boston to teach speech to deaf mutes.</p>

<p>"I made up my mind," said he, "that if I could
make a deaf mute talk, I could make iron talk.
For two years I worked on the problem, but unsuccessfully.
At last, about two years ago, while a
friend and I were experimenting daily with a wire
stretched between my own room at Boston University
and the basement of an adjoining building,
I spoke into the transmitter, 'Can you hear
me?' To my surprise and delight the answer
came at once, 'I can understand you perfectly.'
To be sure," continued the lecturer, "the sounds
were not perfect, but they were intelligible. I
had transmitted articulate speech.</p>

<p>"My problem was a long way toward its solution.
With practically those same instruments, improved
with a year's experimenting, I went to the
Exposition, where, as you know, I interested many
people. Since last June Sir William Thomson
and I have succeeded in talking over a distance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>about sixty miles. Moreover, I have talked, but not
so successfully, between New York and Boston, a
distance of over two hundred miles. To-night I
expect to establish a connection between this hall
and my study in Exeter Place in Boston, eighteen
miles away. My colleague, Professor Watson, is
there, in company with six other gentlemen."</p>

<p>Then, in an ordinary tone, as if speaking to some
one a few feet away, Professor Bell inquired, talking
into the transmitter:</p>

<p>"Are you ready, Watson?"</p>

<p>Evidently Watson was ready, for there came
from the telephone a noise much like the sound of a
horn.</p>

<p>"That is Watson making and breaking the circuit,"
explained Professor Bell.</p>

<p>Soon Arthur heard plainly the organ notes of
"Auld Lang Syne," followed by those of "Yankee
Doodle."</p>

<p>"But that's not the human voice," objected
Arthur's neighbor to his companion. "Musical
sounds we know can be telegraphed."</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Bell spoke again into the transmitter.</p>

<p>"Watson, will you make us a speech?"</p>

<p>There came a few seconds of silence. Then, to
the astonishment of all, a voice issued from the
telephone. All the five hundred people could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>hear the sound, and those less than six feet from
the instrument had little difficulty in making out
the words:</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen: It gives me great
pleasure to address you this evening, though I
am in Boston and you are in Salem."</p>

<p>"I wonder what those men think now," reflected
Arthur.</p>

<p>But the answer was forthcoming.</p>

<p>"We can no longer doubt. We can only admire
the sagacity and patience with which Mr. Bell has
brought his problem to a successful issue."</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the lecture many of the audience
went to the platform to examine the wonderful
box more closely. Arthur and Herbert were of
the number, you may be sure.</p>

<p>"Is it all right for me to speak to Mr. Bell,
Herbert?" whispered Arthur.</p>

<p>"Certainly, if you don't interrupt."</p>

<p>Arthur watched his chance.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bell," he said finally, "you did make the
receiver into a transmitter, didn't you? I saw you
at Philadelphia, you know."</p>

<p>Mr. Bell's puzzled look wore away.</p>

<p>"Why," he exclaimed, "you're the boy I saw at
the Exposition that Sunday afternoon last June,
aren't you?" Then he added, before turning away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>to answer a question that a man was asking, "Better
buy a Boston <i>Globe</i> in the morning. You'll
find a new triumph for the telephone there."</p>

<p>Arthur bought his <i>Globe</i> the next morning before
breakfast. Mr. Bell was right. The paper
recorded even more successes than the boys had
witnessed the night before. Its account of the
evening ended with these words:</p>


<blockquote>

<p>"This special by telephone to the <i>Globe</i> has
been transmitted in the presence of about twenty,
who have thus been witnesses to a feat never
before attempted: that is, the sending of a newspaper
despatch over the space of eighteen miles
by the human voice, all this wonder being accomplished
in a time not much longer than would
be consumed in an ordinary conversation between
two people in the same room."</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Probably no child who reads this story can remember
when the telephone was not so common an
object as a lawn mower or an elevator; but those
of us who lived through the years when its wonders
were slowly developing can never forget our
strange, almost uncanny feeling when the voice of
a friend who, we knew, was miles away actually
came out of a little iron box.</p>

<p>From that day of the <i>Globe</i> report Arthur watched
the telephone grow rapidly into public notice.
Salem people invited Mr. Bell to repeat his lecture;
leading citizens of Boston, Lowell, Providence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>Manchester, and New York within a few weeks
clamored for demonstrations in their cities.</p>

<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>Part of a Telephone Exchange.</small></span></p></div>
</div>



<p>By September, 1878, a telephone exchange was
set up among the business houses of Boston, with
about three hundred subscribers. Two years later
the telephone found its way to the little town
where Arthur lived, and two instruments were installed&mdash;one
at the railroad station and another
at the lawyer's office.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>
<p>The next day came the presidential election;
and in the evening the lawyer's office was filled
with curious men and boys, eager to see whether
the telephone would really work or not. Arthur
and his father were there, of course. But before
any message came,
the lawyer had to see
a client for a few
minutes.</p>




<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/045.jpg">
<img src="images/045_th.jpg" alt="Alexander Graham Bell" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>Alexander Graham Bell in 1900.</small></span></p></div>
</div>




<p>"Here, Arthur,
you've used a telephone
before. Take
my place at the receiver,
will you?"</p>

<p>There was no need
to ask. Arthur was
at the receiver when
the lawyer's question
was finished. No
message came for some time; but at last the bell
rang, and Arthur announced proudly:</p>

<p>"He says Florida has gone Republican."</p>

<p>"I knew the thing couldn't be trusted," sputtered
an old voter then. "As if the solid South
were broken! I'll get my news some other way."
And off he went.</p>

<p>"You didn't hear right, I fancy," said the lawyer,
returning. "The operator couldn't have said that."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>
<p>"But he did," insisted Arthur. "I'm sure he
did."</p>

<p>"And why not?" quietly asked the school teacher
from one corner of the room. "He means the town
of Florida, not the state."</p>

<p>"Of course," said everybody.</p>

<p>By 1883, Arthur heard that conversation had
been carried on between New York and Chicago,
cities one thousand miles apart. "That is all we
can hope for," was the general verdict. For a long
time it seemed true. But when the country had
been covered by a network of wires, there came another
long-distance triumph. Communication was
open to Omaha, five hundred miles farther west.</p>

<p>And not long ago, Arthur, now a prosperous business
man of fifty, a member of the City Club of
Boston, sat with several associates around a table
at the new club house, each with a telephone in
front of him; and over the wires, across three
thousand miles of mountain, lake, and prairie,
came clearly the voices of the governor of Massachusetts
and the mayor of Boston, speaking from
the Panama Exposition at San Francisco.</p>

<p>What will be the next triumph of the telephone?
To transmit speech around the globe, perhaps.
Anyway, here is a newspaper paragraph that asks
an interesting question:</p>

<p>"The <i>Mayflower</i> has been called the last frail
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>link binding the Pilgrims to man and habitable
earth. With its departure from Plymouth in
America that frail link was severed. The Atlantic
cable has surely bound the countries together again.
Will the telephone and the aeroplane make the
desert of the Pilgrims a popular London suburb?"</p>

<h2><a name="A_NEW_ERA_IN_LIGHTING" id="A_NEW_ERA_IN_LIGHTING">A NEW ERA IN LIGHTING</a></h2>


<h3>PART I</h3>

<p>"Uncle John, I've decided to go to Wellesley
College."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear it, Dora. Have you money
enough?"</p>

<p>"That's just the trouble, Uncle John. I have
exactly twenty-four dollars that I've earned picking
berries the last three summers. But I'm only
eleven, you know, and I shan't try to go before
I'm eighteen. That will give me seven more summers
to work. Only I can never pay my college
expenses if I can't earn more than eight dollars a
summer."</p>

<p>"That's true, Dora. I wish I were rich enough
to send you myself. But school teachers are not
wealthy, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't want anybody to give me the
money, Uncle John. I want to earn it. Don't you
know of something that's more profitable than
berry-picking?"</p>

<p>"I'll think about it, Dora."</p>

<p>This conversation took place in 1878, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>Dora's Uncle John, who was a high school principal
in New Jersey, was spending his Christmas
vacation at Dora's home in a little village on the
Maine coast. Nothing more was said about the
college money then; but when Uncle John came
again in February, he showed that he had interested
himself in the ambitious plans of his little niece.</p>




<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/049.jpg">
<img src="images/049_th.jpg" alt="Wellesley College" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>Wellesley College in 1886.</small></span></p></div>
</div>




<p>"Dora," he inquired, "do you want to go to college
as much as ever?"</p>

<p>"Yes, more, Uncle John. Have you thought of
anything for me to do this summer?"</p>

<p>"I know something you can do, Dora, if you
want to."</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle John, what is it?"</p>

<p>"How should you like to work for me?"</p>

<p>"I should like to ever so much. But I don't
know enough yet to correct high school papers.
All I can do is housework."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>
<p>"And that's just what I want of you, Dora.
You didn't know I had leased the Atlantic House,
did you?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, Uncle John. Do you mean you're
coming here summers to manage that hotel?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for the next ten years, anyway, I expect.
Do you like to fill lamps and clean chimneys,
Dora?"</p>

<p>"Why, that's the part of the housework I can
do best."</p>

<p>"That's good. Will you work for me twelve
weeks this summer for three dollars and a half
a week?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle John, of course I will. But isn't
there gas in that hotel?"</p>

<p>"No, just kerosene lamps. I know some people
like gas better, but I don't. It's too dangerous and
it's bad for one's eyes. So even if I could spare the
money this summer, I shouldn't pipe the house for
gas. It can't be many years before there will be
a cleaner and better light. The Wizard will soon
attend to that."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Uncle? Who is the Wizard?"</p>

<p>"The most wonderful man in America, Dora.
His name is Thomas Alva Edison, and he lives in
Menlo Park, New Jersey, not far from where I
teach. I know him a little. He is the man who, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>think, best represents the scientific spirit of the
nineteenth century. He's an inventor, but a systematic
one. He doesn't trust to chance."</p>

<p>"What has he invented, Uncle? I don't think I
ever heard of him."</p>

<p>"I fancy not, Dora. So far his work has been
largely improvements on inventions already made.
Just now, as I said, he is experimenting to find a
way of lighting buildings by electricity. He will
succeed, I know; and I shall wait for his electric
light. I expect, though, to wait a number of years
yet, for even though he should discover the secret
within a few months, no one can supply the
necessary apparatus. It will take years, I'm sure,
before electric lighting is cheap enough to be common."</p>

<p>"How did you get acquainted with such a wonderful
man, Uncle?"</p>

<p>"I knew him first when I was getting ready for
college. Like you, I had my own way to pay;
and I learned to be a telegraph operator. The summer
before I entered Harvard I had a place in the
Boston office of the Western Union Telegraph
Company. Mr. Edison was a young man too, and
he came to work in the office while I was there.</p>

<p>"The night he came we tried to play a joke on
him, but the joke was decidedly on ourselves.
Edison wore an old linen duster, and looked so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>much like a country boy that we thought he couldn't
know much about taking messages. So we arranged
with a skillful New York operator to send a long
message faster and faster, and we saw to it that
the new boy had to take it. To our surprise, he
proved the fastest operator we had ever known and
very carelessly and easily handled the quick dots
and dashes. The joke was on the New York operator,
too, for after a while Edison signaled, 'Say,
young man, why don't you change off and send
with your other foot?'</p>

<p>"An operator like that didn't stay long in the
office. He went to New York, and almost at once
got a position at three hundred dollars a month
because he was bright enough to repair a stock-indicator
in a broker's office. Soon afterward he
improved the indicator so much that the president
of the company gave him forty thousand dollars
for his new idea.</p>

<p>"Next he proved his value to the telegraph company
again by locating a break in the wire between
New York and Albany. The president of the Western
Union had promised to consider any invention
Edison might make if the young man would find
the trouble on the line in two days. Edison was
not two hours in locating the break; and ever
after that the Western Union people were glad
enough to be told of all his new ideas."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>
<p>"Is he working for the Western Union now?"</p>



<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/053.jpg">
<img src="images/053_th.jpg" alt="Ticker" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>Stock Indicator or
"Ticker"</small></span></p></div>
</div>



<p>"No, not now. Just as soon as he had enough
money in the bank so that he could afford time to
experiment, he opened a factory and laboratory of
his own. He made stock tickers for a while; but
he cared more about improving them than selling
them. 'No matter,' I have
heard him say, 'whether I
take an egg beater or an
electric motor into my hand,
I want to improve it. I'm a
poor manufacturer, because
I can't let well enough alone.'
So, instead of making stock
indicators, he went to work
to improve the telegraph.
He saved the Western Union
Company millions of dollars
by making a device for sending
four messages at the
same time over one wire. So
you see he made their one hundred thousand miles
of wire into four hundred thousand without using
any more wire. That's a wizard's work, I think."</p>

<p>"I should think so, too," agreed Dora. "That
seems to me as hard as singing two notes at once."</p>

<p>"But it can be done, nevertheless; and Edison
was so pleased with that invention that he put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>his factory at Newark into the hands of a capable
superintendent and established a laboratory at
Menlo Park, where he is now, about twenty-five
miles from Newark. Then he began to think about
the telephone. Do you know what that is, Dora?"</p>

<p>"I've heard about it, of course, but I never
saw one. There are some telephones in Portland,
though."</p>

<p>"Yes, and there's going to be one here. I'm
going to connect the hotel with the telegraph office
at the station this summer, and sometime I'll
give you a chance to talk over the wire. It's easier
to use the telephone now than it was at first, for
in the beginning there was a continual buzzing that
was very annoying; but Edison has stopped all
that by improving what we call the transmitter."</p>

<p>Dora's idea of a telephone was indistinct; but
she was satisfied with the explanation to come, and
she wanted to hear more of Mr. Edison. "Has he
made anything else?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied Uncle John. "What I think
is the most wonderful thing Edison has done is the
phonograph. Next to the telephone, that to me is
the biggest marvel in the world of science. Think,
Dora, of speaking into a machine that makes a
picture of the sound waves produced by your
voice, and then, a day or a year or a century later,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>letting the instrument work backward and hearing
your own voice exactly as it sounded at first.
Such a mechanism almost frightens me. It makes
me sure that if a man like Edison can keep the idle
words men speak through centuries, the Master
Mind of this universe can keep them for us
forever."</p>




<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/055.jpg">
<img src="images/055_th.jpg" alt="Phonograph" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>Edison's First Phonograph.</small></span></p></div>
</div>



<p>Dora must have caught a little of her uncle's
thought, for she said, slowly, "Do you mean that
everything I say I shall hear again sometime?"</p>

<p>"I don't know exactly, Dora. But I am sure
that God, who gave you power to speak, knows
how to keep your words forever; and I am sure
you will never cease to be glad for all the kind words
you may speak for human ears to hear.</p>

<p>"But I'd almost forgotten about the electric
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>light, Dora. Let me tell you what Edison said about
that the last time I saw him. He told me of seeing
in Philadelphia what is called an arc lamp&mdash;two
pieces of carbon that electricity has heated white
hot and that give off a powerful light, much more
powerful than any gas lamp you ever saw could
give. But a lamp like that, though it makes a fine
street lamp, is not suitable for lighting a house.
It's too bright and too big. Edison says it needs
to be subdivided so that it can be distributed to
houses just as gas is now.</p>

<p>"That's Edison's present problem, Dora. He
is such an untiring worker that I don't believe it
will take many months; and when the process is
perfected and the implements for generating the
electricity can be secured, I mean to make my hotel
the prettiest place at night on the Maine coast.
But meantime, Dora, suppose you learn to wipe
lamps so dry and polish chimneys so bright and
trim wicks so even that every summer visitor at
the 'Atlantic' will be glad to get away for a
while from the flaring, ill-smelling, poisonous gas
light."</p>

<p>"I will, Uncle John, I will! I'll be the best lamp-trimmer
on the whole Maine coast!"</p>

<p>"That's the spirit that will take you to college,
Dora," answered her uncle. "Don't lose a bit of
it."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>



<h3>PART II</h3>

<p>For all the long hot weeks of the next summer
Dora worked faithfully every day on the hotel
lamps. She had to be at her work at eight o'clock
every morning, and she seldom finished before two
in the afternoon. But every week her uncle paid
her three dollars and a half, and by the end of the
season she had forty-two dollars carefully put away.
When the hotel closed, her uncle made her a present
of eight dollars, so that when she started for
school in the fall she rejoiced in the thought of fifty
dollars put away in the savings bank as a college
fund.</p>

<p>She was happy, too, in the prospect of making as
much money the next summer. For the Wizard,
Uncle John told her, had not the secret yet. He
had succeeded in making a platinum wire, encased
in a glass globe, give a light equal to that of twenty-five
candles without melting. But he needed to
exhaust all the air from the glass globe, and still
one one-hundred-thousandth of the original volume
remained.</p>

<p>"But that's not sufficient," commented Uncle
John. "I know enough about the matter to be sure
that so much air as that would prevent the platinum
from giving out the light it ought to give.
Still, within a short time, Dora, I expect even the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>Portland papers will describe Mr. Edison's success
with the electric light."</p>

<p>Uncle John's prediction was fulfilled. By the
first of October the vacuum was so nearly perfect
that only one-millionth part of the original air was
left in the glass bulb. By the last of that same
month, moreover, the whole secret was practically
in Edison's grasp. He had stopped experimenting
with platinum for a burner and had gone back to
carbon, on which he had pinned his faith at first.</p>

<p>But this time he used the carbon only as a coating
for a piece of cotton thread that he had bent
into a loop and sealed up in the almost perfect
vacuum of glass. When this lamp was connected
with the battery, it flashed forth with the brightness
that the inventor had so long waited to see.
But how long would it burn? There was no sleep
for Edison till that question was answered; and it
was not answered for forty hours&mdash;nearly two
days of growing delight and diminishing anxiety.</p>

<p>Such a discovery meant the end of all fruitless
experimenting. The secret of the incandescent
light was revealed; and the newspapers all over
the country&mdash;the <i>Daily Eastern Argus</i> of Portland
among them&mdash;spread the knowledge of the great
event in science and prophesied the speedy conquest
of kerosene and gas. Late in November
Uncle John sent Dora a copy of the <i>Scientific American</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>which gave the authoritative account of what
had been accomplished.</p>



<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/059.jpg">
<img src="images/059_th.jpg" alt="Edison" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>Edison in his Library.</small></span></p></div>
</div>




<p>"But," wrote Uncle John in the letter accompanying
the paper, "now the real work has only begun.
The Wizard knows that some carbonized material is
what he needs, but he is sure that carbonized cotton
thread is not the best thing. Now he is carbonizing
everything he can lay his hands on&mdash;straw, tissue
paper, soft paper, all kinds of cardboard, all kinds of
threads, fish line, threads rubbed with tarred lampblack,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>fine threads plaited together in strands, cotton
soaked in boiling tar, lamp wick, twine, tar and
lampblack mixed, and many other materials that
I can't remember. Why," finished Uncle John, "so
far he has examined no fewer than six thousand
different species of vegetable growth alone. Somebody
said something to him the other day about
his wonderful genius. 'Well,' modestly answered
the great man, mopping his forehead with his handkerchief,
'genius, I think, is one per cent <i>in</i>spiration
and ninety-nine per cent <i>per</i>spiration.'"</p>

<p>In December there came into Dora's life the
most happy and exciting experience of her childhood.
The letter from Uncle John in November
had ended with this paragraph:</p>

<p>"I am looking forward to my visit to Maine next
month, but I'm sorry to say it must be earlier and
shorter than usual. I have an important engagement
here for the twenty-fourth, and I'm planning
to reach Maine on Saturday, the twentieth, spend
Sunday with you, and leave there the twenty-second.
But I have thought of a way of making
my visit last longer and of giving you a new kind
of Christmas present. That way is to take you back
with me to Jersey and let you see what Christmas
and New Year's in the neighborhood of New York
are like. If you approve my new idea for Christmas,
I want you to let me know at once."</p>

<p>If any twelve-year-old child who lives fifty miles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>from a city and has never been farther from home
than that city in her life is reading this, she will
know how Dora felt at the prospect of such a
Christmas journey, and she will understand, too,
how Dora had her answer ready for the post office
in less than an hour after she had read her letter.</p>

<p>The only event of Dora's wonderful vacation that
this story has a right to tell is her visit to Mr.
Edison. It happened that in the <i>Herald</i> Uncle
John bought as the train was nearing New York,
there was a long article describing the lighting system
that Mr. Edison had put into successful operation
at Menlo Park. "Interest is getting so great
in the incandescent light," remarked Uncle John,
"that I shouldn't wonder if Mr. Edison let the public
see it in operation. If he does, you and I are
going to Menlo Park."</p>

<p>The prophecy was a true one. On New Year's
Mr. Edison opened his grounds to the public, the
railroad ran special trains, and over three thousand
people visited Menlo Park. Here is the enthusiastic
letter that Dora wrote next day to
Maine:</p>


<blockquote>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Newark, N. J.</span><br />
<i>Jan. 1, 1880</i>
</p>

<p><i>Dear Father and Mother,</i></p>

<p>I have been to Fairyland. The enclosed clippings
will tell you all about it. I saw the king of
the fairies too&mdash;I mean Mr. Edison&mdash;and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>said, "Good evening, little girl," to me. He
talked with Uncle John quite a while, and I
heard all they said. Some one asked Mr. Edison
when New York would be lighted by electricity
and he answered, "I'm working night and day,
but you see I have to produce not only a practicable
lamp, but a whole system. I haven't
found the best material for filaments yet, and
there's not a place in the world where I can buy
the dynamos (those are machines for making
the electricity, Uncle John told me) and the
smaller appliances."</p>

<p>Then Uncle John said, "Well, Edison, I'm
waiting patiently till you make electric lights
cheap enough for me to wire my hotel on the
Maine coast. Can you make a prediction?"</p>

<p>"None that's safe," Edison answered. "You
know the opposition of the gas companies, and
you know the present high cost of the experiments.
I've spent already over forty thousand
dollars without returns, and my lamps are costing
almost two dollars apiece. The public won't
take them till they can be sold for forty cents or
less. Moreover, I'm not satisfied with my paper
carbon lamps. No, there is much work left; but
I shall work day and night till New York has a
central station and every appliance we need is
manufactured at small cost."</p>

<p>"I suppose eating and sleeping don't bother
you much just now," some one said.</p>

<p>"Not very much," answered Edison. "I eat
when I'm hungry, and I sleep when I have to.
Four hours a night are enough, for I can go to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>sleep instantly, and I always wake up rested."</p>

<p>Uncle John says that Mr. Edison is the greatest
inventor the world has known. Just think of
that! And I have seen him!</p>

<p class="right">
Yours affectionately,<br />
<span class="smcap">Dora</span><br />
</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Here are two newspaper clippings that Dora
enclosed in her letter:</p>


<p class="center">I</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">A NIGHT WITH EDISON</p>

<p class="right">
<i>Menlo Park, N. J.</i><br />
<i>Dec. 30, 1879</i><br />
</p>

<p>All day long and until late this evening, Menlo
Park has been thronged with visitors coming
from all directions to see the wonderful "electric
light." Nearly every train that stopped
brought delegations of sightseers till the depot
was overrun and the narrow plank walk leading
to the laboratory became alive with people. In
the laboratory the throngs practically took possession
of everything in their eager curiosity to
learn all about the great invention. Four new
street lamps were added last night, making six
in all, which now give out the horse shoe light
in the open air. Their superiority to gas is so
apparent, both in steadiness and beauty of
illumination, that every one is struck with admiration.</p>

</blockquote>


<p class="center">II</p>


<blockquote>

<p>The afternoon trains brought some visitors,
but in the evening every train set down a couple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>of score, at least. The visitors never seemed
to tire of lighting the lamps upon the two main
tables by simply laying one between the two
long wires. Most were content to ejaculate
"Wonderful!" But no amount of explanation
would persuade one old gentleman that it was
not an iron wire that was inside the glass tube.
"It could not be the carbon filament of a piece
of paper, for," said he, "I have seen some red
hot, white hot iron wire, only it was not quite
so bright, but it looked just like that. That's
no filament!"</p>

<p>"This is a bad time for sceptics," I said to
Edison.</p>

<p>"There are some left," he answered. "They
die harder than a cat or a snake."</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Dora's New York visit colored all the next five
years that she worked and waited for college. Her
interest in the electric light never wavered for an
instant. Like many another, she marveled at the
thoroughness of Mr. Edison's search for the right
sort of filament and followed expectantly reports
of those men whom he sent around the world in
search of it.</p>

<p>She read with a bit of almost personal pride the
item in the Portland paper that told how, on September
4, 1882, at three o'clock in the afternoon,
electric light was supplied for the first time to a
number of New York customers; and when, in
1884, that same paper stated that at Brockton,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>Massachusetts, the first theater ever lighted by
electricity from a central plant had been thrown
open, she wrote her uncle:</p>

<p>"I'm sure you'll have to discharge your lamp
trimmer pretty soon. But I don't care now, for
with father's help, I think I can enter Wellesley in
the fall. Of course I hope to work one more
summer for you."</p>

<p>Uncle John answered that letter in person, for
he needed to go to Maine to make arrangements
for the summer.</p>

<p>"I congratulate you, Dora," said he. "You
deserve a college course. But I shan't discharge
you yet. I expect now to wire the hotel by 1889;
but even if I shouldn't need a lamp trimmer all
the time till then, I shall always be glad of a capable
waitress.&mdash;Will you work for me the next
three summers?"</p>

<p>"Of course I will, Uncle John," replied Dora as
eagerly and gratefully as she had made the same
reply six years before. "With the money I can
earn the next three summers, I can lessen college expenses
a good deal."</p>

<p>So it happened that the ambition of Dora's girlhood;
largely through her own pluck and persistence,
was realized in due season. Still, she always
felt that Mr. Edison unknowingly had a large share
in the making of her career; for when in after years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>she became an instructor in physics at an influential
school, she could easily trace back her love for her
subject to her interest in the early experiments
upon the electric light.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_TRIUMPH_OF_GOODYEAR" id="THE_TRIUMPH_OF_GOODYEAR">THE TRIUMPH OF GOODYEAR</a></h2>


<h3>PART I</h3>

<p>In March, 1852, Lucy Hobart began a six
months' visit with her grandparents who lived just
outside Trenton, New Jersey. One morning at the
breakfast table, Grandfather Hobart, whom most
people called Lawyer Hobart, said to Lucy, "Little
girl, a most important case is being tried at the
court house this week. It may not be very interesting
to a child, but I think that you, as well as Grandmother,
ought to attend this morning. I want you
to be able to say that you have heard the great
Daniel Webster make a plea."</p>

<p>"Do you mean Daniel Webster of Massachusetts,
Grandfather?" inquired Lucy. "I thought," she
resumed rather timidly, for she feared Grandfather
might think she was contradicting him, "I
thought people didn't like him any more."</p>

<p>"You come from a strong anti-slavery family,
Lucy, the worst kind," answered Grandfather,
good-humoredly. "Webster did seem to many
people to sacrifice his ideal in that seventh of
March speech two years ago, but he's a keen lawyer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>yet. His health is broken, though, from the criticism
he has suffered. I don't believe he will live
much longer. That's why I think you had better
go to-day."</p>

<p>"I should like to ever so much," replied Lucy.</p>

<p>"Is it the Goodyear case?" inquired Grandmother.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Grandfather. "It's his case
against Horace Day, who, I think, has been
outrageously infringing his patents."</p>

<p>"It's raining a little," remarked Grandmother.
"Shall you take us if it keeps on?"</p>

<p>"If you feel like going. If it hadn't been for Mr.
Goodyear, you know, you couldn't have gone anyway
on such a day," Grandfather added.</p>

<p>"Why couldn't we?" inquired Lucy, after trying
to think it out a few seconds.</p>

<p>"My stars! Don't you, a Boston girl, know
about Goodyear and his rubber goods?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe so," answered Lucy. "Unless,"
she added after a pause, "you mean the man that
advertises in the <i>Transcript</i> every night. Ever
since I could read, I've seen advertisements in the
paper about rubber that's been heated to two
hundred and eighty degrees."</p>

<p>"Yes, Lucy, that's an advertisement of the
Charles Goodyear I mean. I've known him a good
many years (he's only a little younger than I, and
we were both born in New Haven), and he's had a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>hard, sad life so far. To be sure, he's reckoned now
as one of New Haven's prosperous business men;
but unless he wins this suit, his poverty will come
back again. Shall I tell you a little about him so
that you'll understand some of the references you'll
be sure to hear at the trial?"</p>




<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/069.jpg">
<img src="images/069_th.jpg" alt="Birthplace of Charles Goodyear" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>Birthplace of Charles Goodyear</small></span></p></div>
</div>




<p>"Oh, I wish you would, Grandfather."</p>

<p>Breakfast was over then; and as Grandmother
went to the kitchen to give her orders for the day,
Grandfather said:</p>

<p>"You and I, Lucy, will sit in front of the fire a
little while and talk about Mr. Goodyear. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>first you'd better go with Grandmother and let her
give you my galoshes and my rubber cap, and her
rubber shoes and your own."</p>

<p>A little girl of to-day, on hearing that request,
might not know exactly what she had been sent for.
Rubber goods were too expensive then to be common,
and "rubber shoes" had not been shortened to
our "rubbers." The awkward <i>galoshes</i> was just a
name for high rubber shoes, or overshoes.</p>

<p>Lucy came back soon, her arms full. The cap
she placed on a table, and the three pairs of rubber
shoes she put carefully down to warm in front of
the fire.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't have been safe to put my galoshes
that I had twenty years ago so near the fire," commented
Grandfather, as Lucy drew up her chair
beside his. "Can you guess what would have happened
to them?"</p>

<p>"Would the fire have burned them, Grandfather?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly, but it would have melted them,&mdash;at
least have made them as soft as suet. What
Goodyear has done is to invent a way of preparing
rubber or gum elastic so that it can be used in various
thicknesses without being stiff as iron in cold
weather or softening like wax with the heat."
Then Grandfather interrupted his statements with
a question:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>
<p>"Do you know where we get gum elastic, Lucy?"</p>

<p>"Let's pretend I don't know anything about
rubber," answered Lucy judiciously, after a pause.
"You begin at the beginning, Grandfather."</p>

<p>Grandfather smiled at the little girl's strategy
and began at the beginning.</p>

<p>"Gum elastic is really the dried
sap of the South American rubber
tree. To get it, the trees are tapped,
just as maple trees are tapped here.
But the rubber sap is yellowish
white and thick as cream. The
natives of Brazil long ago discovered
that this sap, when hardened, would
keep out water. So they made
bottles from it and sent the bottles
to Europe and the United States.
Finally the Portuguese settlers in
South America made the hardened
sap into shoes; and in 1820 I saw in
Boston the first pair of rubber
shoes ever brought into the United
States. They were as clumsy looking as Chinese
shoes. They were gilded, too, not so much to
make them beautiful as to keep the rubber from
melting."</p>




<div class="figright"><a href="images/071.jpg">
<img src="images/071_th.jpg" alt="Tapping a Rubber Tree" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>Tapping a Rubber Tree</small></span></p></div>
</div>



<p>"Oh, but they must have been handsome," commented
Lucy. "They must have looked just like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>gold slippers. How much did they cost, Grandfather?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Lucy. I'm not sure that they were
intended to be sold. Two years afterward, though,
when there were five hundred pairs for sale in Boston,
the price was pretty high. I paid five dollars
for mine, I remember. These were not gilded, but
they were just as thick and unshapely as the
first ones were. They were better than nothing,
though, when the weather was not too hot nor too
cold.</p>

<p>"During the next few years I suppose there were
at least a million pairs of rubber shoes brought into
this country and sold for four or five dollars a pair.
Then, of course, enterprising New Englanders began
to think that if people wanted rubber shoes
so much, there would be a good deal of profit in
manufacturing them. Then rubber companies
prospered for a while; but customers soon found
that the rubber shoes they bought were spoiled by
heat or cold, and every rubber company went
rapidly out of existence.</p>

<p>"It was just about this time that Mr. Goodyear
sent for me to come to Philadelphia. He was in
the jail there, I'm sorry to say, but for no fault of
his, and he needed a lawyer's advice. The hardware
firm he belonged to had failed, owing thirty
thousand dollars; and though he could in no way be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>blamed for the disaster, on account of our poor
debtors' laws he had been sent to prison. In spite
of his misfortune, he was not downcast. 'It's unfair,
Hobart,' he said; 'but there's a way out.
Look into this kettle. That's gum elastic I've
been melting. The secret of rubber will pay
that thirty thousand dollars and give the world
the most important commercial product of the
century.'</p>

<p>"I was glad he was so cheerful, for I couldn't
give him much encouragement about keeping out
of prison. Our laws were unfair, just as he said,
and I knew that his creditors were likely to send
the poor fellow to prison again and again. And so
they did for ten long years. But his faith in rubber
never wavered. Just after he had been released the
first time, I called on him again. 'Here's the means
of good fortune, Hobart,' he cried cheerfully; and
he showed me a mass of rubber he was pressing into
shape with his wife's rolling-pin."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid there was always more rubber than
bread under that rolling pin!" commented Grandmother,
just then passing through the room on an
errand.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so," agreed Grandfather. "But,
Lucy, your grandmother never had much patience
with Mr. Goodyear's experiments. I remonstrated
a good many times, myself. 'Goodyear,' said I,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>when I found him once in a little attic room in New
York, boiling his gum with all sorts of chemicals,
'why not give it up? You can't do it without money,
and nobody believes in rubber now.'</p>

<p>"'Don't try to discourage me,' he answered. 'I
know I shall succeed. What is hidden and unknown
and cannot be discovered by scientific research
will most likely be discovered by accident; and it
will be discovered by the one who applies himself
most perseveringly to his task.'</p>




<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/074.jpg">
<img src="images/074_th.jpg" alt="Natives Drying Rubber" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>Natives Drying Rubber</small></span></p></div>
</div>



<p>"No one could dissuade him. He borrowed money
and made several hundred pairs of handsome rubber
shoes that, when summer came, melted and smelled
so bad they had to be buried; he won a prize for
his beautiful rubber tablecloths and piano covers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>but a drop of acid stained and spoiled them. The
story of these years was disappointment and poverty.
Once, to pay the house-rent, Mrs. Goodyear had
to sell the household linen that she herself had
spun; and many times, if kind friends had not sent
food and money, the little Goodyear children would
have had nothing to eat.</p>

<p>"Still, even in those dark days, there were moments
of rejoicing. Three times Goodyear thought
he had succeeded: once, when he mixed magnesia
with the rubber; once, when he boiled the rubber
in quicklime and water; and once, when he cured
the surface of his rubber with what chemists call
nitric acid. Moreover, another experimenter gave
him a valuable clue. Some one in Massachusetts,
a man named Hayward, I believe, claimed that in
a dream, he had been told to use sulphur in rubber-curing.
He obeyed the dream, patented the process,
and sold the patent to Goodyear. After that,
Goodyear could make thin rubber fabric that could
withstand both heat and cold. But he wanted to
cure rubber in masses, not in films."</p>

<p>"Couldn't he sell the things he made of the thin
rubber, Grandfather?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he sold a number of aprons and tablecloths
and such articles, but they didn't bring him
much money. They attracted attention to him,
though, and pretty soon the national post office
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>department gave him an order for one hundred
and fifty mail bags. Here was his opportunity. He
was almost sure of success this time, for it was summer,
and the heat did not seem to affect the rubber
at all. Still, when the bags were finished, he hung
them up for hotter weather to test, and took a vacation.
When he returned, the mail bags were dropping
from their hooks in shapeless, ill-smelling
lumps. The world said, 'We told you so.' But
Goodyear said to me after that failure, 'It wasn't
the curing, Hobart, that ruined those bags. It
was the coloring matter. That made them decompose.'</p>

<p>"This failure only made Goodyear redouble his
efforts. He moved his family to Woburn, in Massachusetts,
where he had been experimenting, and
began to work night and day. People who had
heard of his persistence would come to see him,
and he would tell them of his discoveries and his
certain hopes. Finally, one night, when he was talking
to such a group, quite by accident he dropped
upon a hot stove a piece of rubber that had been
mixed with sulphur. To his surprise and delight,
the rubber did not melt, but charred like leather.
He had found the secret. And what a simple secret
it was! Rubber could be cured by mixing it
with sulphur and heating it very hot.</p>

<p>"This happened in 1839, when Goodyear was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>thirty-nine years old. He had practically solved
his problem; but for nearly two years more no one
would help him or even believe him.</p>

<p>"There, Lucy, I've told you the story from the
beginning. I haven't finished it yet; but I want
you to have a chance to say a word. Do you
know what this process of curing rubber is called?
We tan leather, you know. What do we do to
rubber?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe I know, Grandfather."</p>

<p>"I saw you reading about the Latin gods and
goddesses yesterday. Who was the god that hammered
and made tools?"</p>

<p>"Vulcan, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and we use that word to help name the
process of curing rubber. Just add the suffix-<i>ize</i>
and what do you have?"</p>

<p>"Vul-can-ize," spoke Lucy, slowly.</p>

<p>"That's it. And now can you tell when rubber
has been vulcanized?"</p>

<p>"When it has been treated with sulphur and
heated very hot."</p>

<p>"And what were the unsuccessful ways of vulcanizing
that Goodyear tried?"</p>

<p>"He used magnesia, quicklime and water, and
nitric acid."</p>

<p>"Good. That shows you listened and understood.
Now I'll tell you the rest. It's a sad story.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>But Goodyear is prosperous now, you know; and
I think Mr. Webster will bring justice back."</p>


<h3>PART II</h3>

<p>"When Goodyear dropped that piece of rubber
on the hot stove, he lost no time in putting the new
process to the test. He nailed the rubber outside
the kitchen door in the intense cold. In the morning
he brought it in, holding it up exultantly. It
was as flexible as when he had put it out the night
before. Then he cut a square yard of thick rubber,
treated this new piece with sulphur, and with the
help of his wife and children cured it in front of his
bedroom fire.</p>

<p>"The experiment was a thorough success; and
from this piece of rubber he made a cap for himself
that has never been injured by any heat or cold or
rain or acid. But the process was far from perfect;
and Goodyear saw that the changeful heat of
an open fire must be replaced by something hotter
and steadier and something that he could control.
But how hot must the fire be and how long must
the heat be applied? Hopefully he set about answering
these questions.</p>

<p>"He would toast a lump of rubber over the
kitchen fire sometimes an hour, sometimes a whole
day; he would hold rubber against the steaming
nose of the tea-kettle; he would put a batch of it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>into the oven of the cook stove and bake it, sometimes
two hours, sometimes six. Indeed he would
often sit up till long past midnight to watch his
baking pans.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/079.jpg">
<img src="images/079_th.jpg" alt="Goodyear's kitchen" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>Kitchen in which Goodyear made his Experiments</small></span></p></div>
</div>


<p>"Often he begged his friends in a Woburn factory
to lend their oven for his rubber; and they, considering
his experiments useless but harmless,
would grant his request. Day after day, however,
the truth eluded him; and day after day food for
his family grew scarcer and scarcer. He pawned
everything he could spare, even his children's
school books.</p>

<p>"At last one morning after a heavy snow storm,
with the secret almost within his grasp, he awoke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>to find that there was not one particle of food in
his house nor one penny in his purse. Besides, he
was sicker than most people are when they decide
to stay in bed till they feel better. But he had a
wife and four children that must be fed. He got
up and stumbled through the drifts for nearly five
miles, so tired and hungry that many times he almost
fainted.</p>

<p>"Luckily, the friend he went to see proved a real
friend, and lent him money enough to support his
family and keep on with his experiments during
those winter days. But though with this assistance
he found out just the details he needed
to know for vulcanizing the rubber, ill-health
and poverty, instead of growing less, increased
with the certainty of his discovery. He was
constantly troubled with dyspepsia. He was so
deeply in debt that people had no faith in him.
They remembered the rubber shoes and the mail
bags; but they forgot the splendid courage that
had never accepted defeat. As so often happens,
Goodyear was a genius without the power of persuasion.
He had to wait for his discoveries to be
his mouth-piece.</p>

<p>"But his waiting time was his testing time and
proved his honesty and his single-heartedness. A
French concern offered to pay for the privilege
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>of using his first important discovery&mdash;that rubber
could be cured by nitric acid&mdash;his acid-gas
treatment, he called it. What a temptation that
offer was, Lucy, it is impossible to realize; but
Goodyear was too honest to sell a half truth
for a truth, and he wrote to France that he was
almost in the possession of a greater secret which
he would gladly sell when he had learned it all.</p>

<p>"Just a little money now stood between Goodyear
and assured success; and the quest for a paltry
fifty dollars, which would pay his fare to New York
and provide for his family during his absence,
took him through the darkest days of his life.</p>

<p>"He thought of a friend in Boston who might be
willing to lend the money. So, having prevailed
upon a Woburn shop keeper to give his family
credit for a while, he set out to walk the ten miles
to Boston on his pitiful errand. But the friend
(perhaps I ought to call him by another name)
refused the loan; and, worse luck, while Goodyear
was still in Boston, he was sent once more to
prison for those debts so long ago forced upon
him. His father somehow brought influence to
bear for a release; and then Goodyear spent a week
tramping about Boston streets, inviting this man
and that to lend him a little money, sleeping and
eating the while at a small hotel. But every one
turned him only a deaf ear; and when the hotel bill
came, he had to leave in disgrace.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>
<p>"That night he walked to Cambridge, where, to
his great relief, he found shelter with a friend; and
the next morning, more discouraged than ever before,
he walked wearily back to Woburn. But a
greater trouble awaited him at his threshold. His
little boy, two years old, who had been perfectly
well when he went away, was dying. His wife was
sick in bed; the faithless store keeper had refused
further credit, and the family were literally starving.
Was there ever a more pitiable case? There
was just one friend left, and to him Goodyear
turned. That friend sent seven dollars and a
reprimand. Moreover, a sympathetic man, happening
to hear the story in the friend's office, sent
the Goodyears a barrel of flour.</p>

<p>"The money and the flour helped, of course, but
they could not save the little son's life. Still, those
precious dollars must be spent on the living, not
the dead; so they carried the little body on a wagon
to the grave, and the sorrowing father walked behind.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to say that this is the darkest part of
the story. Somebody finally lent Goodyear the
fifty dollars he wanted; and the inventor went to
New York, interested the right people, proved to
a rich brother-in-law that success was in sight,
and perfected his rubber.</p>

<p>"When people found that Goodyear had really
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>succeeded with his problem, rubber became even
more popular than it had been fifteen years before.
Rubber goods began to be manufactured in large
quantities; and Goodyear, having patented his
process, made the profits he deserved. Do I need
to tell you, Lucy, what the honest man did first
with his money?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe so, Grandfather. Of course he
paid his debts."</p>

<p>"Indeed he did. And besides, he's been able to
maintain his family comfortably ever since. But
Goodyear will never be an enormously rich man.
He's been wickedly cheated and his patents have
been infringed again and again. Of course he's
been fighting for his rights, but the case has been
dragging on these seven years. His opponent is
a man named Day, who is trying to prove that,
although he once promised Goodyear not to manufacture
any such articles of rubber as must be completed
by the use of artificial heat and sulphur,
that agreement is invalid because Goodyear is not
the inventor of the process."</p>

<p>"He couldn't say so, Grandfather, if he knew
all you have just told me, could he?"</p>

<p>"It seems perfectly plain to you, Lucy, as it
seems to me, that only Goodyear is entitled to
credit for the invention. But I think I have
shown you that Goodyear hasn't been much of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>business man. He's always been so unfortunate
in protecting his own rights that perhaps there will
be found some legal flaw
in his patents. I sincerely
hope not, but the distinguished
Rufus Choate has
been taking charge of Day's
claims; and if those claims
have any force, Choate
will find it. We shall hear
this morning only Webster.
Mr. Choate and his partner
Mr. Cutting, have already
presented their arguments
for Day."</p>

<h3>PART III</h3>

<p>It was only a short drive to the court house, and
Lucy, with her grandparents, was in her seat
promptly at ten o'clock. It was the little girl's
first visit to a court room; and the sight of the
judges in their gowns and the other solemn-looking
officials was strange to her. But she had eyes
mostly for two people&mdash;Mr. Goodyear and the
great Webster. She expected to know Webster,
for she had seen many pictures of him; but on the
drive over she had asked her grandfather how she
should recognize Mr. Goodyear.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>
<p>"I'll tell you," he replied, "what one of Goodyear's
acquaintances once said in answer to a similar
question: 'If you meet a man who has on an India
rubber cap, stock, coat, vest, and shoes, and carries
an India rubber purse without a cent in it, that is
he.'"</p>

<p>Though Lucy had been amused at the description
without expecting to profit by it, she now
pressed her grandfather's arm and asked excitedly:</p>

<p>"Is that Mr. Goodyear&mdash;that man with the
rubber cap and the rubber vest?" indicating a tall,
rather thin, kindly, but keen-eyed man who was
talking earnestly at the front of the room.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is. And see, there come Mr. Webster
and the judges!"</p>

<p>Silence now settled over the court, and Lucy
watched and listened eagerly. The formalities of
opening were quickly over. It was announced that
the counsel for Mr. Day having spoken previously,
the court would listen to that for Mr. Goodyear.</p>

<p>Then slowly and with dignity the great Webster
stood up to make what proved to be his last speech
in any court room. To Lucy and to many another
who looked for the first time upon the most eloquent
orator of the century, he was a handsome,
scholarly man, with conviction behind every word.
Others, however, like Lawyer Hobart, who had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>known Webster in the earlier days, before he had
experienced the humiliation of wide-spread public
distrust and the bitterness of repudiated friendships,
felt that the once sturdy frame had weakened
and that in the depths of those dark eyes the fire
of righteous resentment burned less fiercely. But,
though crushed in spirit, the great man was still
keen and invincible in intellect; and the calm vigor
of his mind that morning immortalized in human
annals the rugged honesty, the sublime patience of
the inventor who, despite discouragement, despite
temptation, never stepped aside from his high purpose
of bestowing a great good upon mankind.</p>

<p>Mr. Webster made a long speech, during the
technical parts of which, even though Lucy knew
that she was listening to the greatest orator in the
country, her attention wandered in spite of herself.
But, young as she was, she appreciated the
straightforward and convincing argument and
could follow easily its main points.</p>

<p>"Whatever may be Mr. Goodyear's claims,"
declared Mr. Webster early in his speech, "to the
great invention now spread out to the ends of the
earth and known to all the world, this record
shows, other records show, everybody knows that
he is a man of inquisitive, ingenious, laborious
mind."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Webster summarized the history of Goodyear's
long struggle, referring first to the days when
India rubber was useless in weather that was either
very hot or very cold.</p>

<p>"I well remember," he asserted, "that I had
some experience in this matter myself. A friend
in New York sent me a very fine cloak of India
rubber and a hat of the same material. I did not
succeed very well with them. I took the cloak one
day and set it out in the cold. It stood very well
by itself. I surmounted it with the hat, and many
persons passing by thought that they saw on the
porch the farmer of Marshfield."</p>

<p>Next the speaker reminded his hearers of the
present improvements in such articles, all due to
the perseverance of his client, and made a prophecy
which our day is rapidly fulfilling:</p>

<p>"I look to the time when ships that traverse the
ocean will have India rubber sails, when the sheathing
of ships will be composed of this metallic vegetable
production. I see, or think I see, thousands of
other uses to which this extraordinary product is to
be applied."</p>

<p>Then with delicate irony the great lawyer attacked
the argument of Mr. Choate. "Those observations
are all very eloquent and very pathetic,
but they have one drawback. Nothing is beautiful
that is not true. The invention exists. Everybody
knows and understands it, and everybody
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>connected in former times with the manufacture
of India rubber has been astonished and surprised
at it.</p>



<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/088.jpg">
<img src="images/088_th.jpg" alt="Daniel Webster" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>Daniel Webster</small></span></p></div>
</div>



<p>"If Charles Goodyear did not make this discovery,
who did make it? They do not meet
Goodyear's claim by setting
up a distinct claim
of anybody else. They
attempt to prove that
he was not the inventor
by little shreds and
patches of testimony.
We want to know the
name and the habitation
and the location of this
man upon the face of
the globe who invented
vulcanized rubber, if it be not he who now sits
before us."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Well," queried Grandmother on the drive
home, "will Goodyear win, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"It's a peculiar case," returned her husband.
"Day's in the wrong, I know. But I wish Goodyear
had had the vision of the sulphur himself instead
of paying Hayward for it."</p>

<p>"But he paid for Hayward's patent," objected
Grandmother.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes, luckily. And Webster never pleaded better.
It will come out right, I think."</p>

<p>"Of course Goodyear will win," decided Lucy
to herself without knowing she was prejudiced.
But aloud she asked, "When will the judge decide,
Grandfather?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no one can say," was the reply. "Probably
not for some weeks, anyway."</p>

<p>It proved to be six whole months, however, before
the decision was rendered. Lucy's visit was
almost at an end when one day in September Grandfather
came in with the newspaper. "Well, here's
good news for Goodyear," he exclaimed. "Hear
this." And he read aloud the article which concluded
with these words:</p>

<p>"It is due to Mr. Goodyear to say that I am
entirely satisfied that he is the original inventor
of the process of vulcanizing rubber as stated in
his bill; and that he is entitled not only to the relief
which he asks, but to all the merits and benefits
of that discovery."</p>

<p>"I wonder how much money Goodyear had to
pay for his victory," commented Grandmother.</p>

<p>"Oh, Webster will make money. Of course
Goodyear won't have to pay it all, for several rubber
firms united with him against Day to protect
their own interests. The talk among the lawyers
when I came away was that Webster would get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>somewhere in the vicinity of twenty-five thousand
dollars. I don't believe Goodyear even in these
last years has made so much as that above his expenses.
But he's generosity itself when he has anything
to give. What do you suppose he's sent to
Mr. Webster for a present?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. He's so unpractical that he'd
give his house away if some one wanted it," answered
Grandmother, whose own good judgment
could not be denied.</p>

<p>"I think you're a little severe," answered her
husband. "But you won't be surprised to know
that he's sent to Marshfield that handsome thoroughbred
that he drove Webster to the court house
with, because Webster admired the animal so
much."</p>

<p>"Just exactly like him!" was the response.
"He'll probably wish some day he had the money
that colt would bring."</p>

<p>Lucy did not go to Trenton again for eight years.
On her next visit, strangely enough, Grandfather's
household was again talking of the beloved, unpractical
dreamer, who by this time had sacrificed
his life in the interests of humanity. For Mr.
Goodyear had come to the end of his useful,
honored, but difficult career. In spite of his triumphant
success, his health had been permanently
broken by hard work and worry, and his last years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>had not been entirely free from the occasional
threatenings of poverty.</p>

<p>Indeed, by an unlucky circumstance, again his
misfortune but not his fault, he was thrown once
more for a short time into a debtors' prison when
he was visiting France on a business trip. But the
friends who knew him pitied him, trusted him,
and honored him to the end; and though Lucy
Hobart is now almost seventy-eight years old
and has seen most of the prominent Americans
of the later nineteenth century, she remembers
no one who worked harder or suffered more for
the good of humanity than the undaunted Goodyear
who insisted, "If it is to be done, it must
be done and it will be done. Somebody will yet
thank me for it."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_EASIER_WAY_OF_PRINTING" id="THE_EASIER_WAY_OF_PRINTING">THE EASIER WAY OF PRINTING</a></h2>


<h3>PART I</h3>

<p>On the very first day of a Christmas vacation
about forty years ago Jimmie Granger broke his
leg coasting. That meant six weeks in bed and no
more of the wonderful coasting of that winter.
Jimmie was only twelve years old, and he found it
hard to lie still and be cheerful while the other fellows
were having so much fun. Every day seemed
a week long until he was allowed to sit up; even
then each seemed three times as long as usual.</p>

<p>Jimmie's Uncle Francis was so sorry for his unlucky
little nephew that he always brought something
"to kill time" when he came to spend Sunday
at Jimmie's home just outside the big city. Two
weeks after the accident Jimmie received from his
Uncle Francis the present he liked best of all. It
was a small printing press, something entirely new
to Jimmie, who had never seen one before, and never
had thought very much about how books and newspapers
are actually made.</p>

<p>"If you'll print me every week until you can walk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>again the <i>Home Record</i>, a newspaper page four columns
wide and ten inches long, giving the news of
the house, and of the neighborhood, too, if you like,
I'll give you another double runner, a better sled
than the old broken one."</p>

<p>"Oh, not another double runner! You don't
want him to break the other leg!" cried Jimmie's
mother.</p>

<p>"Of course not; but you don't want him to stop
coasting, do you?" Uncle Francis asked his sister.</p>

<p>"N-o-o," replied Jimmie's mother.</p>

<p>"And we both think he has learned never to take
the risk he took before, don't we?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Jimmie's mother.</p>

<p>Jimmie wanted a new double runner more than
anything else, and so he went right to work on his
little newspaper. The printing press was not large
enough to print the paper all at once, and so it was
printed in parts and these were pasted on a large
sheet of paper of the size ordered.</p>

<p>Uncle Francis was specially interested in newspapers,
because he was editor of a big city daily
called the <i>Record</i>. Jimmie felt that of course his
uncle would be very critical and that the little
<i>Home Record</i> must be just right. The morning
after he started the paper he had a bright idea:
he would ask his mother to be head proof reader&mdash;Jimmie
felt pretty shaky about spelling and punctuation;
and he would ask Tom Frazer, when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>came over to see him, if he would not be head reporter
and tell him what was happening outside&mdash;Tom
always knew what the fellows were doing.
He could give Tom the rear sled of his old double
runner, which was not broken in the accident.
Tom had said he should have to have a new sled,
and that was really a very good one.</p>

<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>A Monk Copying Manuscript Books</small></span></p></div>
</div>



<p>Both assistants seemed glad to serve and the
work began merrily. When Jimmie's father came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>home that night he said he would be the "printer's
devil."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Jimmie.</p>

<p>"Don't believe they have them now," said his
mother.</p>



<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/095.jpg">
<img src="images/095_th.jpg" alt="The First Printing" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>The First Printing Looked Like This</small></span></p></div>
</div>



<p>"They don't need so many of them in these days
of steam perfecting presses as they used to, but
surely the printer has to have assistants even to-day,"
said his father. "Perhaps now that machinery
does so much of the work the men do not
get black and inky enough to be called 'devils.'
While Jimmie has to lie with that leg fixed as it is
now, he will want some one to run that press when
he gets everything ready for the printing. Don't
you think so, son?"</p>

<p>Jimmie agreed with his father, as he looked at
the leg so straight and stiff.</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to have your help as a&mdash;what
is it they call it&mdash;a pressman? I think that I
shall have something ready to print to-morrow
night," said Jimmie&mdash;and he did.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>
<p>As Jimmie was the whole newspaper force except
the head proof reader, the head reporter, and
the head pressman, he had both to set the type
and to write the newspaper himself. Writing compositions
Jimmie detested, but writing a newspaper
he found was not half bad.</p>


<div class="figleft"><a href="images/096.jpg">
<img src="images/096_th.jpg" alt="Type B" style="width: 80%" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>A Type Enlarged</small></span></p></div>
</div>



<p>"Don't see what you can write about," his father
said jokingly. "There's nothing doing in
this house when <i>you</i> have to keep still."</p>

<p>Jimmie did not, however, suffer from
any lack of news. In fact, his friends
brought him so much that the second day
he started a baseball column and the
third day a society column.</p>

<p>The type setting was interesting to
Jimmie because it was all new to him.
His type was just like the type in a
printing office. Each piece was a thin
bar of metal with a raised letter on the
end, unless it had a punctuation mark instead of
the letter, or was blank in order to make proper
spaces between the words. Each letter of a word
had to be picked up by itself out of the case of
type and put in place before the next letter of the
word could be placed where it belonged.</p>

<p>It was slow work and it was a little hard at first
to be spelling a line of words with every letter upside
down, but Jimmie found out the very first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>thing that it had to be so if the words were to be
right side up on the printed page. It made <i>Widow</i>
look like this:


<img src="images/097_th.jpg" alt="Widow (inverted)" style="width: 5%"  />


 but it did not take long to
learn to read the words that way to make sure
they were right.</p>

<p>When the type for the first column of the paper
was in order and securely locked into the form
which held it, there were two things more to be done&mdash;inking
the type and pressing the paper on it.
Jimmie did the inking and his father put on the
paper and took off the impression. The first printing
showed that Jimmie had been too lavish with
his ink, but the second was so good they put it
away for his Uncle Francis.</p>

<p>"Our history says that Benjamin Franklin learned
the printer's trade. Did he set the type and print
this way?" Jimmie asked his uncle the first time
he came out after Jimmie became a printer.</p>

<p>"Yes, just that way," answered his uncle. "In
Benjamin Franklin's time and most of the time ever
since, each letter has had to be picked up by hand
and put in place. There is a little type-setting
machine now which is quite a help, but we need
something better."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you ever get a daily paper
ready," exclaimed Jimmie. "It must take millions
of letters."</p>

<p>"Not so many, I think," replied his uncle, "but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>enough so that it does take a good many girls to
set the type. There is going to be a great change
soon, however, because in a short time there is
going to be an entirely new type-setting machine.
Mr. Ottman Mergenthaler of Baltimore has been
working on one for ten years and it is almost ready
for us. When that is perfected it will be as wonderful
as the big presses though
it is not a large machine. He
will call it the linotype (line-of-type).
It will work somewhat
like a typewriter. When the
operator strikes a letter on the
keyboard that same letter in
the type will be freed from its
place in the type case and
come sliding down a path, or
channel, to take its place in
the word and line that is being
set. When this machine is perfected one person
will be able to do as much as four now can."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/098.jpg">
<img src="images/098_th.jpg" alt="Franklin's Printing Press" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>Franklin's Printing Press</small></span></p></div>
</div>



<p>"If Benjamin Franklin could visit our newspaper
office at the present time," continued his
uncle, "what would astonish him most are the big
steam cylinder presses. He never saw anything
but a hand press of the simplest kind."</p>

<p>"Mine is a hand press, isn't it?" asked Jimmie.
"Yes, a very small hand press. Many of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>old hand presses were taller than a man. One that
Benjamin Franklin actually used is in the patent
office in Washington. You'll see it some day probably.
I think I can describe it so that you can get
a picture of it. Did you ever see your Grandmother
Manter's cheese press? No? Do you remember
the linen press that your Great-aunt Caroline has
for decoration now in her dining room? I don't
suppose you do. Well, the old hand presses were
made on the same principle as the cheese and the
linen presses and the cider press. They stood high
like the cheese press, and were made of two upright
beams with two cross beams between them,
like a capital H, only there were two cross pieces
instead of one. The lower cross beam served as
a support, or table, on which to place the type
in the page 'form' when ready for printing.</p>

<p>"Over the type, after it was inked, was laid the
paper, slightly dampened; over this was laid a
blanket. Then a heavy weight had to be put on
top the blanket and pressed down hard on the inked
type in order to make a good print. This weight
was a large wooden block fastened to the lower end
of a great wooden screw which extended up through
the upper cross piece. To turn this screw so that
the block was pressed hard enough on the blanket
and the paper to get a good clear print, and then to
loosen the screw so that the printed sheet could be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>taken out and dried was no easy matter. The
printer must use a long iron bar to turn the screw.
This he would fit into a hole, or socket, in the screw
and then, using this handle, turn the screw as far
as he could."</p>

<p>"I know," said Jimmie. "There's a picture of
that in my history. The poor fellow is just breaking
his back to get more of a turn on that screw."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it. There were several sockets
around the head of the screw. The printer would
turn the screw as far as he could with the bar in
one socket, and then fit the bar into the next to get
more of a turn. How I should like to see Franklin
or Gutenberg or any other famous old-time printer
examining the new press that will be ready for use
in the <i>Record</i> office in a month or so. I think he
would be speechless."</p>


<h3>PART II</h3>

<p>The day before his uncle's next visit Jimmie set
his type to say, "Much interest is felt in the new Hoe
press which will be installed in the <i>Record</i> office
early next month. It is the first of the kind to be
used by any newspaper in the city and will mark
a revolution in newspaper printing. This new 'perfecting
press' will make it possible to print 24,000
eight-page papers an hour&mdash;a thing not dreamed
of a few years ago. People are anxious to see this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>fast press printing, cutting, folding, and delivering
the papers all ready for the newsboys."</p>

<p>"You really know of somebody who is anxious
to see the press, do you?" asked his uncle with a
twinkle in his eye when he read the item in Jimmie's
paper.</p>

<p>"Guess I do," said Jimmie. "Honestly, I won't
be any bother; I won't be <i>any</i> bother; I won't ask
any questions except about the press&mdash;cross my
heart and hope to die."</p>

<p>Uncle Francis laughed. He knew Jimmie too
well to think he would not be any bother, but he
said, "All right; as soon as you have two good legs
again I'll invite you to see the new machinery."</p>

<p>Jimmie's leg mended as fast as the leg of any
boy should, and he was able in March to take the
trip to the city. Jimmie's mother went with him.</p>

<p>"I want to see the big press, too," she explained to
her brother.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you came," said Uncle Francis as he
greeted her. "I should think every man and
woman in the United States would be interested in
this new kind of printing press. Do you know, it
will bring down the price of a paper from a nickel
to three cents! They have just begun to print the
afternoon edition. Shall we go now to see the new
Hoe rotary perfecting press? It is the most wonderful
thing in printing that has ever been invented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>since Gutenberg invented movable type more than
four hundred years ago. It seems as though it
must mark the limit in fast printing, but who knows?
Surely Gutenberg and Faust would have thought
our old press with the pages of type on a stationary
flat bed over which rollers and paper passed, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>limit of wonders. Come and see this new press eat
up the paper!"</p>



<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/102.jpg">
<img src="images/102_th.jpg" alt="The Earliest Printers" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>The Earliest Printers at Work</small></span></p></div>
</div>



<p>They soon stood before a great throbbing
monster, a mystery of wheels within wheels and of
gleaming steel. At one end was a huge roll of white
paper; at the other was an unceasing stream of
newspapers. Jimmie watched in wide-eyed wonder.
He heard his uncle say that the huge roll, or web,
of white paper was being fed into one end of the
press, was being printed on both sides, the newspaper
sheets were being cut apart, folded, and finally
delivered, counted, at the other end of the press.
How could it be done!</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of it all?" asked Uncle
Francis, turning to Jimmie.</p>

<p>Jimmie hardly took his fascinated gaze from the
great whirring monster.</p>

<p>"It's great! It's a hundred times more wonderful
than I thought it would be! Now that I've seen
what this press can do I think I shall run one of
these instead of being an editor."</p>

<p>His uncle laughed. "All right," he said; "you
see how this runs, do you?"</p>

<p>"Not <i>all</i> of it," admitted Jimmie.</p>

<p>"Probably the type part bothers you," said his
uncle, "because you are accustomed to seeing the
type in a flat steel frame, or chase, as we call it.
Here it is on the outside of one of those huge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>rollers, or cylinders, as we call them. Do you
see it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jimmie, "but there isn't any type on
the cylinder just under it."</p>

<p>"No," answered his uncle, "the other is the impression
cylinder. Those two big cylinders work
together like the rollers of a clothes wringer. That
broad ribbon of paper, just as wide as our newspaper,
goes between the two cylinders as clothes
pass between the rollers of the wringer. The impression
cylinder rolls the paper hard against the
inked type cylinder and prints one side of the paper.
If one of the rollers of a clothes wringer had ink
marks on it they would be printed on the clothes
as they went between the rollers, wouldn't they?
That is the way this press works. Can you see the
paper as it goes on?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and there are two more cylinders like the
other pair!" cried Jimmie.</p>

<p>"That's right," answered his uncle. "I think
you can see that when the paper passes between
the second pair the other side of the paper is printed.
Just get your eye on the paper as it is unwound
from that enormous spool, or web, and watch as
far as you can. The white paper in that web is a
strip four miles long and as wide as two pages of
the <i>Record</i>. The type cylinders turn so fast you
can't see what is on them, but there is enough type
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>to print four pages of the newspaper on each cylinder."</p>

<p>"Why do they need such a quantity of small
black rollers?" asked Jimmie's mother.</p>

<p>"Those small rollers you are watching are inking
cylinders," answered her brother. "They are
very important in the printing. See them keep
inking the type cylinder, rolling against the part
which has just done some printing as it turns around
to print again. I don't believe you can see the ink
fountain which covers them with ink so that they
in turn can cover the type, but it is there, working
all the time."</p>

<p>"It is easy enough to see why it is called a rotary
press," said Mrs. Granger. "Cylinders and cylinders
and cylinders rolling round and round and
round."</p>

<p>"Do you see why it is called a perfecting press,
Jimmie?" asked Uncle Francis.</p>

<p>"No, I don't believe I do. Do you, mother?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I think so. Look at the other end of
the press and see those newspapers fairly pouring
out all cut from the web, folded, and even counted.
If they are completed in every respect so that there
is nothing for anybody to do but sell them, I should
think the press might be called a perfecting
press."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>
<p>"Of course," assented Jimmie, "that's the reason.
Why didn't I see it?"</p>



<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/106.jpg">

<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>Curved Stereotype Plate</small></span></p></div>
</div>



<p>"Shall we go back to the office now where there
is less noise and see what to-day's paper says?"
asked Uncle Francis after giving Jimmie a good long
time to watch the press. "There is one thing more
I should like to have you see, but it is too late for
you to do so to-day. Give one look at the type cylinder
before you leave. Can you see that the type
is not in little pieces of one letter each, but is in
solid pieces of metal curved to fit the cylinder?"
On the way back to the office Uncle Francis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>showed Jimmie a stereotype plate which he could
study at close range.</p>

<p>"These plates are what you saw on the type
cylinder," explained Uncle Francis. "You shall
see one made sometime. In these days in the big
offices after the real type is set letter by letter it
isn't used for the printing at all. It wears it out
too fast to print 50,000 newspapers from it each day,
and besides it takes too much type. Instead of using
the movable type for the printing, we cover the
type with a soft substance like soaked up pasteboard,
press it hard on the type, dry it, and have a
perfect copy of the type except that the letters are
little hollows instead of raised pieces.</p>

<p>"This copy, or model, is used for a mold into
which we pour liquid metal. When this cools we
have, you see, another copy of the type and in
this the letters are all raised. The mold is curved
to fit the cylinders before the molten metal is
poured in, so that the stereotype plate, as the
page of fixed type is called, can be clamped tight
on the big cylinder. It is these big plates that you
have seen used for type on the press cylinders."</p>

<p>"Jingles! but it is some work to print a newspaper!"
exclaimed Jimmie.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is, and it is a very wonderful process,
too, more wonderful every year. You and your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>mother will be interested in this paragraph in to-day's
paper," said his uncle, passing Mrs. Granger
one of the freshly printed papers. "In that article
about the new press are some striking comparisons
you will enjoy."</p>

<p>"What a change in printing!" said Mrs. Granger.
"Just listen, Jimmie! 'The old flat screw press of
the colonial period could print fifty small papers
on one side in an hour; the Washington compound
lever hand press in 1829&mdash;the best hand press
ever made&mdash;brought the number up to 250; the
revolving cylinder press made it possible to print
about 1000 an hour; then in 1847 the Hoe lightning
press printed 30,000; and now the Hoe rotary perfecting
press prints on both sides,&mdash;not a little
four-page paper, but a large-sized eight-page paper&mdash;at
the rate of 24,000 an hour!'"</p>

<p>"Jingles!" said Jimmie again, for what can a
boy say to such figures as those.</p>

<p>When Jimmie reached home that night he announced
to his father that he was going to be a
newspaper man.</p>

<p>"I'm willing," replied his father. "The printing
press has done more for the progress of civilization
than anything else, and the modern newspaper is
one of the greatest factors in the world's advancement.
Go ahead. You'll live to see the printing
press reach even more people than it does now."</p>

<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>Sextuple Perfecting Press</small></span></p></div>
</div>


<p>Mr. Granger was right. When Jimmie was no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a><br /><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>older than his uncle had been on the day that Jimmie
first saw a big press, Jimmie did indeed see
another wonder. It was a Hoe Double Octuple
Press&mdash;the biggest press in the world in 1912&mdash;which,
with others built on the same principle even
if they were smaller, made newspaper printing
cheap enough so that a sixteen-page paper could
be sold for one cent.</p>

<p>The grown-up Jimmie felt as he stood by the new
press very much as he felt years before. Could
there be a more wonderful machine? Eight rolls
of paper were feeding the monster; eighteen plate
cylinders were revolving, each carrying type enough
for eight pages of a large newspaper; the cylinders,
turning at a speed of three hundred revolutions a
minute, were consuming paper at the rate of 108
miles of paper six feet wide in an hour. Jimmie,
then an experienced newspaper man, watched the
four sets of folders pouring out thirty-two-page
papers at the rate of 75,000 an hour, until he turned
away, saying, "Can it be possible that printing will
ever be easier? How I wish Benjamin Franklin
could see this press! How he would glory in its
possibilities! It is perfectly true that the printing
press is to literature what the steam engine is to the
industries, and what the locomotive is to traffic."</p>

<h2><a name="ANNA_HOLMANS_DAGUERREOTYPE" id="ANNA_HOLMANS_DAGUERREOTYPE">ANNA HOLMAN'S DAGUERREOTYPE</a></h2>


<p>When Anna Holman was twelve years old she
had to sit perfectly still for one hundred twenty
seconds&mdash;think of it! two whole minutes!&mdash;to
have her picture taken. Now she could have it
taken in one hundredth of the time at one hundredth
of the cost.</p>

<p>The only likenesses of people which Anna knew
about before she was twelve were the pictures in
the parlor of her home. Two of these were pictures
of her Grandfather and Grandmother Holman,
whom she had never seen. These pictures always
interested her, though for a certain reason she did
not like them.</p>

<p>Anna had been told that her grandmother was a
great beauty in her day, and she often tried to see
if she could tell how her grandmother had looked.
This she never felt sure she knew, as the picture
was only a silhouette. Of all the different kinds of
pictures that people have had made, the silhouette,
surely, is the most unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>These were not uncommon in the days before
photography was known. They were made by
using a strong light to obtain a clear, black shadow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>of the profile of the sitter, and then cutting from
plain black paper as perfect a copy as possible of
the shadow head. Of course, the sitter was always
posed for a direct side view in order to get an outline
of the features; and, of course, in such a picture
the expression of the face was wholly lacking.</p>



<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/112.jpg">
<img src="images/112_th.jpg" alt="Silhouettes" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>Silhouettes of Grandfather and Grandmother</small></span></p></div>
</div>



<p>When Grandmother Holman sat for her silhouette
and the picture maker had cut out the little black
shadow which her beautiful head had made, Grandfather
Holman said, "It is perfect, Rebecca";
and then when Grandfather Holman, in turn, had
sat for his picture and the picture maker had cut
a silhouette which showed very little but his straight
nose and strong chin, Grandmother Holman said:
"It is just like you, James."</p>

<p>They knew each other well enough to supply the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>expression which the pictures lacked. In fact they
were so well pleased with the little black paper
heads that they had them mounted on white cards
and framed for the parlor, never dreaming how these
same silhouettes would some day disappoint a little
granddaughter who wanted to know how her grandparents
had really looked.</p>

<p>In the same room was a life-size oil portrait of
Anna's great grandfather. This she liked, and she
felt that she knew just how he had looked.</p>

<p>"Why didn't Grandmother Holman have some
artist paint a picture of her?" Anna asked her
mother one day.</p>

<p>"It cost too much," her mother answered. "She
wanted a portrait of your grandfather and he wanted
a portrait of her; and I think there never was money
enough to have a good artist paint them both. I
wish we were rich enough to have a miniature of
you painted, Anna. Perhaps we shall be sometime.
Your Aunt Anna in her last letter says she wishes
we would send her a daguerreotype of you for her
Christmas present.</p>

<p>"I know very little about these new pictures,
but they are a wonderful kind which the sun makes.
I have heard that they are not very expensive,
and I think that if there were only a chance here
in town to have the daguerreotype taken we might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>do what she suggests. These pictures, as I understand
it, are entirely different from anything you
and I have ever seen: they show the face, the eyes,
the smile&mdash;everything, like a portrait&mdash;but there
are no colors; the pictures are all in black and white."</p>

<p>Anna had really been wondering, ever since
she heard of her aunt's wish, why anybody should
care to have a picture of a girl who had freckles
and straight yellow hair and blue eyes, instead of
curly black hair and black eyes. When she heard
her mother's last words she laughed merrily.</p>

<p>"Would my hair be black in the picture? And
my eyes, too?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so," answered her mother with a
smile.</p>

<p>"How lovely! How I hope I can have my picture
taken!"</p>

<p>Later that very day when Anna went down town
on an errand she saw this notice:</p>


<blockquote>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">COMING AUGUST 20</span><br />
<br />
<i>Prof. Aaron B. Coleman, Artist,</i><br />
<br />

will open a daguerreotype gallery and furnish<br />
perfect likenesses of his patrons for $2.00 a picture.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Abigail Silsbee joined Anna while she was still
studying the notice.</p>

<p>"I'm going to have my picture taken!" exclaimed
Abigail joyfully. "Mrs. Follen saw some daguerreotypes
in Boston when she was there, and she says
they are splendid. She told mother about them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>yesterday, and mother says I may have one taken.
Why don't you have your picture taken?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall," answered Anna. "I'll tell
my father and mother about the notice."</p>

<p>At supper time when Anna brought up the matter
of having her picture taken, her father did not
approve.</p>

<p>"I do not believe there are any satisfactory
pictures except oil portraits," he said. "I think it
would be just a waste of money."</p>

<p>By that time, however, Anna had become quite
enthusiastic over daguerreotypes. She had learned
during the afternoon of three of her friends who were
going to have their pictures taken.</p>

<p>"May I have mine taken if I earn the money
myself?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed," her father replied, and then
dismissed the matter, feeling that when she had seen
a daguerreotype she would have no further interest
in them.</p>

<p>It was then two weeks before the artist, as he
called himself, would come to town. Anna went
to work at once picking blueberries. The berries
were plentiful, and Anna's purse held enough money
for the picture before the two weeks had passed.
Anna, however, did not go to the picture gallery the
first day it was opened. She waited to see Abigail's
picture. When Abigail fairly danced into the house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>the second afternoon after the artist's arrival, Anna
was much disappointed at first, because she thought
Abigail had left the picture at home.</p>

<p>"See!" cried Abigail, holding up something that
looked like a little black wooden book. It was
about four inches by three and a half and not more
than half an inch thick.</p>



<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/116.jpg">
<img src="images/116_th.jpg" alt="Abigail's Daguerreotype" /></a>
<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>Abigail's Daguerreotype</small></span></p></div>
</div>



<p>Abigail unfastened the two tiny brass hooks
which held the two covers together, and displayed
the picture inside. Fitted into one of the covers
and framed by a mat of red velvet was a likeness
of Abigail which made Anna gasp with surprise.
There was Abigail's face, Abigail's smile, even the
sprigs of roses on Abigail's new delaine dress. It
was not a colored picture, to be sure, but otherwise
it was just as good a picture as an oil painting, so
Anna thought.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>
<p>Such daguerreotypes as that of Abigail, and the
ambrotypes and the ferrotypes which were advertised
at almost the same time&mdash;so quickly were
new kinds of pictures invented when once the
process of photography was discovered&mdash;were the
first portraits made by the camera. Compared with
the beautiful photographs of to-day, these pictures
taken during the ten years preceding the Civil
War seem very poor and unsatisfactory; but to
those who had never seen any likenesses except
either the oil portraits or the silhouettes, these likenesses
made by the camera were very wonderful.</p>

<p>It is rather surprising that the pictures taken
when Anna was a child were as good as those still
in existence show them to have been. It had been
little more than ten years since Monsieur Daguerre
had announced to the French Academy his invention
of photography. Unlike most other inventors
he actually wished all his discoveries to be made
public, and as a result, the further discoveries of
other men greatly hastened the development of
the art.</p>

<p>In 1839, when Daguerre announced his discovery,
he exposed his picture one hour and twelve minutes.
This, of course, meant that it could not be used for
portraits until the exposure could be reduced to a
reasonable length. The use of different chemicals
from those Daguerre used soon brought the time of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>exposure to thirty minutes; but one of the newspapers
of the day says that the portraits taken
then were "terrific likenesses of the human visage."</p>

<p>By 1850 such improvements had been made that
one writer says that in the large cities cameras
were as common as hand organs, and that the pictures
were no longer "terrific." The credit for all
this surely belongs to the far-seeing inventor who
asked that he might give to the public all that he
had found out, in order that other men might build
on his discoveries.</p>

<p>After seeing three of these new pictures, it was
no wonder that Anna could hardly wait until the
next day to go to the photographer's herself. That
night at bedtime she said to her mother, "I suppose,
if my hair is going to look black in the picture, I
could have black curls if you were willing to do up
my hair on rags."</p>

<p>"Do you really want me to?" asked her mother,
hoping Anna would decide against the curls.</p>

<p>"Of course I don't. I was just joking. I want
Aunt Anna to have a real picture of me," replied
Anna.</p>

<p>The first thing the next morning Anna wanted to
know when they should go to the photographer's.</p>

<p>"Right away after dinner I think will be the best
time," her mother answered.</p>

<p>Accordingly, as early in the afternoon as possible,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>Anna dressed to have her picture taken. As this
was back in 1853, Anna wore, although she was
only twelve years old, a full, ruffled skirt which
came almost to the tops of her brown gaiter boots.
The boots were her special pride, and as they were
the very first she had ever owned with kid vamps and
cloth tops, she did hope they would show in the picture.
She wore her best white guimpe, which was
cut in what was called a half-low neck; her sprigged
muslin, which had very large, flowing sleeves; and
her new white muslin undersleeves, which had been
a present from Aunt Anna. Her hair was parted in
the middle and held in place on the sides by a round
comb.</p>

<p>"Do I look all right?" Anna asked, turning
slowly for her mother to inspect her.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so, and to me you look very nice,"
her mother answered. "Don't you think you'll
need your galoshes? The showers last night have
left the streets very muddy."</p>

<p>"I'll wear them, for I'm sure I don't want anything
to happen to my beautiful boots," said Anna,
and so she buckled on a pair of the clumsy rubber
overshoes which they wore in those days.</p>

<p>Anna wanted a full length picture; her mother
said little, but preferred the head and shoulders
only, as the face then would be so much larger and
plainer. Finally it was decided to have the little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>girl seated in a quaintly carved high-backed chair.
In those early days of photography Anna must
keep still two minutes&mdash;one hundred and twenty
seconds&mdash;instead of one second, and so it was
really better to sit than to stand.</p>

<p>When Anna was seated, she folded her hands,
and held her head very high. The photographer
said her position seemed a little stiff, and so he
turned her head slightly to one side and gave her
the choice of a stuffed bird or a paper rose to hold
in her hands. Anna chose the rose because it was
pink and matched the roses in her new sprigged
muslin dress. She forgot that the picture would be
all black and white anyway. She felt more at ease
when she had something to hold and was sure she
could sit as still as a stone for one hundred twenty
seconds or even twice that.</p>

<p>The photographer went behind the great, awkward
machine which he called a camera and covered
up his head and part of the camera, with
what looked to Anna like a tablecloth. She almost
laughed, and the photographer, who was looking
through the camera, told her almost sharply not
to smile so much because it made her open her
mouth.</p>

<p>"Say 'Flip' to make your mouth small and get
it into shape again," he directed.</p>

<p>Anna said "Flip," anxious at the same time to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>try "Flop" to see if it would make a large mouth.
It was just as well she did not delay matters just
then by trying, for only a very little later she actually
read in the Boston <i>Transcript</i>: "For a small
mouth 'Flip,' for a large mouth 'Cabbage.'"</p>

<p>"All ready," said the man at last, after he had
taken his head from under the shawl several times
to arrange the folds of Anna's skirt, to turn her
head a little more, or to straighten her shoulders.
Then he slipped the plate for the picture into place
in the camera and said, "Now look pleasant."</p>

<p>Anna did her best to do so, but her mouth felt
stiff, and she wanted both to wink and to swallow,
and, worst of all, her nose itched. It seemed one
hundred twenty minutes instead of one hundred
twenty seconds to the little girl, but at last the
photographer said, "All done."</p>

<p>In those early days of photography the completed
picture was the very plate which had been placed
in the camera. They did not know then how to
print from the plate as photographers do now, and
so the plate on which the image was made was developed
and "fixed" and then mounted under glass
in such little cases as Abigail's. Only one picture
could be made at a time, and pictures were consequently
expensive.</p>

<p>It did not take long, however, to develop a daguerreotype
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>and mount it. Soon Anna was looking
at her own picture. She thought it very good
indeed and secretly felt it more elegant than Abigail's,
because she was seated and showed the whole
figure, and Abigail's was only of head and shoulders.</p>

<p>"Good!" said Anna's father when he saw it. "I
didn't believe there was much in this new process
of photography, but there is. Monsieur Daguerre
and all those who have made improvements on his
discovery certainly deserve great honor. This is
really a picture of my little girl. If this is Aunt
Anna's, then I must have another to keep myself."</p>

<p>"It really is a good picture of Anna, isn't it?"
said Mrs. Holman as her husband passed it back
to her. Then, as she looked again at the picture,
she laughed merrily. "It is a very good picture of
the galoshes, too."</p>

<p>"The galoshes!" exclaimed Anna.</p>

<p>"The galoshes!" said her father.</p>

<p>"Didn't I take them off?" asked Anna.</p>

<p>"It must be that you didn't," replied her mother.
"Never mind; it must be a very fine picture of
you yourself or we should have seen the galoshes
sooner."</p>

<p>Anna wondered if her Aunt Anna would notice
the overshoes. The present reached her aunt in
her far-off western home on Christmas day.</p>

<p>"I am delighted with the picture," she wrote.
"It is like having a visit from my dear little niece.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>It seems as if she could speak to me if she wished.
What a lovely dress, and what a lovely guimpe!
Really, I am so pleased with the picture that I
even admire the <i>galoshes</i>."</p>

<p>Anna had many other pictures taken before she
was grown up, but she said she always felt the marvel
of sitting before a camera for the sun to reflect
and imprint her features on a plate which she could
not see. Indeed, the faithfulness and the certainty
of the result always made her declare that she could
never have her picture taken without recalling the
lines which Lucy Larcom wrote after her first daguerreotype
was made:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_THE_REAPER" id="THE_STORY_OF_THE_REAPER">THE STORY OF THE REAPER</a></h2>


<p>"What if Cyrus McCormick should be able to
make his reaper really work and we could cut all
that wheat by machinery! No more dreadful backaches
then in harvest time!" said Ezra Harding,
as he stood looking out of the back door of a Virginia
farmhouse one bright morning in June in the
year 1832.</p>

<p>He saw nothing of the beauty all around him;
all he saw was acre upon acre of yellow wheat ready
to be harvested. How he dreaded the harvesting!
It meant the hardest work his father ever asked
him to do. Help was so scarce that even Ezra, the
youngest of the five Harding boys, though he was
only fifteen, had to do a man's work. It made Ezra
feel almost eighty to think about the back-breaking
work that was to begin the next morning.</p>

<p>At that time all the wheat in the world was cut
by hand, and on that account there was not enough
raised so that everybody could have white bread.
In the old world the peasants used chiefly the sickle
to cut the wheat; in the new world the farmers preferred
the scythe and cradle. To harvest wheat
means both to cut it and to tie the long stalks into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>bundles, or sheaves, for the drying which is necessary
before the wheat kernels are threshed out. Hay
can be pitched about hit-or-miss, but not so the
wheat. It must be tied up in an orderly fashion
so that as it dries it can be gathered into the barns
without shaking out and losing too many of the
wheat kernels.</p>



<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/125.jpg">

<div class="caption">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>The Old Way of Reaping</small></span></p></div>
</div>


<p>Ezra knew his part would be to swing a cradle
scythe. This was a rather broad scythe with a
wooden frame attached which was called a cradle.
This cradle was nothing more than a set of wooden
fingers parallel with the scythe, which helped to
lay the cut grain straight in the rows because they
collected the grain and carried it to the end of the
stroke. The straighter it fell, the easier it was to
bundle it. The contrivance was clumsy and Ezra
disliked it very much. However, he was thankful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>he did not have to follow the men who mowed the
grain and do the bundling and tying. That work he
knew was the most back-breaking of all.</p>

<p>Ezra was feeling anything but cheerful when he
saw his father come out of the barn with a smile on
his face.</p>

<p>"What do you think I heard last night at Lexington
Court House?" his father asked, coming up
the path. "Cyrus McCormick is going to try his
new reaping machine here in Lexington in Farmer
Ruff's wheat field to-day. I want to see the trial.
We'll all go over, if you boys like."</p>

<p>Like to go? Indeed they would, and they thought
of nothing but the possibility of a successful reaping
machine all through breakfast time.</p>

<p>Late in the season the preceding year Cyrus
McCormick had created a sensation by cutting six
acres of oats in an afternoon at Steele's Tavern
near his home eighteen miles north of the Hardings'
farm. None of the Hardings had seen that event,
but they had been deeply interested not only because
they would welcome a successful reaping
machine, but also because the young man's father,
Robert McCormick, was a friend of Mr. Harding,
and they knew of the repeated trials and failures
of the father's reaping machine. In fact, Robert
McCormick had worked for fifteen years on a reaper
which he had tried for the last time in that same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>season of 1831 and then had reluctantly put away
forever as a failure.</p>

<p>"I still believe a successful reaping machine is
possible, but somebody else will have to make it,"
he had said sadly.</p>

<p>The Hardings knew that the son Cyrus, who
had worked for years with his father, had not given
up even then, and, begging his father to leave one
small patch of grain for him to use for trial, had
started a new machine on a different principle,
and late in the season had tried it at home with
only his own family to watch its working.</p>

<p>"It is a success!" they had said one to another,
but they dared say very little outside because it
was still far from satisfactory.</p>

<p>Mr. Harding had learned from the older McCormick
that it had not run smoothly, but that it
had cut the grain without tangling it and had left
it on a platform from which the raker could take
it off in good order for the bundling. To the McCormicks,
however, it had been a proof that the machine
could be made a success, and a few days later, after
making some changes, Cyrus McCormick had cut
the six acres of oats at Steele's Tavern in one afternoon.
It was then too late in the season for other
demonstrations, and the Hardings had heard nothing
more about the invention until the day before
the trial at Lexington in Farmer Ruff's field.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>
<p>An hour before the time set for the trial of the
reaper Ezra Harding and his brothers were at the
appointed place. They watched the crowd gather.
There were Negroes, and farm laborers, and some
owners of farms. Most of the people around Ezra,
to his surprise, not only seemed to expect the machine
to fail, but actually hoped it would. He
could not understand why until he heard two
rough, ignorant fellows talk about losing their
chance to earn their bread if machines could be
made to do the work of men.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><small>The First Type of McCormick Reaper</small></span></p></div>
</div>



<p>"We'll smash the things," they said, "before
we'll have the bread taken out of our mouths by
any such contraptions."</p>

<p>Ezra thought it strange they should oppose the
invention for he knew how anxious his father was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>that it should be a success. His father said machinery
meant the possibility of larger crops, and therefore
not less work, but more work and more wealth
for all. Ezra was puzzling over the strange stupidity
of these men who could not see what larger crops
would mean, and who seemed to want to go on in
their old back-breaking toil, at the same pitifully
small wages,&mdash;for the pay of these days was actually
less than a nickel an hour,&mdash;when the machine
came in view drawn by two horses. Two
Negroes were leading the horses because the machine
made such a clattering noise that it frightened
them. About a hundred spectators had
gathered by that time. The crowd jeered at the
sight of the strange machine.</p>

<p>"It's drunk," they said, and laughed uproariously
at their own wit.</p>

<p>On it came, turned into the field, and began in
a short time to cut the wheat. It did not work well.
The field was rough and hilly, and the heavy,
cumbersome machine careened like a ship in a gale.
The crowd ran up and down the field alongside the
machine, hooting at the top of their voices and calling
the reaper all kinds of names. The Negroes
were doubled up with laughter at the slewing of
the unwieldy machine. One man said to another
with decision, "Give me the old cradle yet."</p>

<p>Another said scornfully, "It's a humbug!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>
<p>Farmer Ruff, rough by nature as well as by name,
ran, too, shouting, "Stop! Stop! your machine is
rattling the heads off my wheat!"</p>

<p>It did look as if the trial would end in complete
failure. Much as Ezra wished the machine to succeed
he had no confidence that it was going to,
and he turned to see if he could read his father's
thoughts. Just as he turned he saw a fine-looking
man on horseback ride up to the jeering crowd. It
was Hon. William Taylor. Taking in the situation
at a glance he changed everything instantly.</p>

<p>"Pull down the fence," he ordered, pointing to
the division fence between his field and that of Farmer
Ruff, "and cross over into my wheat field. I'll
give you a fair chance to try your machine!"</p>

<p>This opportunity was eagerly seized by the young
inventor, and soon he was ready to begin again the
trial of his precious machine. Mr. Taylor's field was
smoother and less hilly than that of Farmer Ruff.
The machine began to cut the grain successfully.
Once around! Ezra could scarcely credit his eyes.
Round and round the machine went&mdash;cutting,
cutting, cutting. The heavy clack-clack of the machine
was sweet music to the little group of those
who were eager for its success.</p>

<p>The crowd became quieter as the grain continued
to fall, and many after an hour or two lost all interest
in watching and went home. For nearly five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>hours the reaper was driven around Mr. Taylor's
field, and the six acres of wheat were cut in that time&mdash;the
first wheat in the United States to be cut by
machinery. No wonder the young inventor was
proud of the accomplishment. His machine had
done in less than half a day what he knew would
have required, according to the method generally
used in Europe, twenty-four peasants with sickles.</p>

<p>After the trial was over, Mr. Harding and Ezra
joined the excited little group around the inventor.</p>

<p>"Your reaper is a success," Ezra heard Robert
McCormick say to his son, "and it makes me proud
to have a son do what I could not do!" Ezra felt
like throwing his cap and cheering. What a joy
to have a machine which could do that back-breaking
work he had had to do in harvesting the grain!</p>

<p>That night the machine was hauled to the court
house square in Lexington. There it was examined
by a crowd of curious people who had heard of the
successful trial in the afternoon. One of the men
who was specially interested in the machine was
Professor Bradshaw of the Female Academy of
Lexington, a thoughtful man whose judgment was
greatly respected in the community. In his usual
impressive manner he fairly astounded the bystanders
by the wholly improbable statement,
"That machine is worth&mdash;a&mdash;hundred&mdash;thousand&mdash;dollars!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>
<p>"A hundred thousand dollars!" repeated Mr.
Harding when the remark was told him the next
day. "I think this time Professor Bradshaw is
wrong. Cyrus McCormick will be disappointed,
surely, if he expects any such large returns from his
invention. The great inventors have not become
very rich men even when the invention, like the
cotton gin, has caused a revolution in a whole
industry."</p>

<p>This was when Cyrus McCormick was twenty-three
years old. Before he was an old man the
reaper had proved itself worth more millions than
the predicted thousands, and Ezra and his father
had many a laugh over Mr. Harding's criticism of
Professor Bradshaw. However, at the time the astounding
remark was made, not even the inventor
himself dreamed of the complete change in methods
of farming which the reaper would make all over
the country. Nobody, indeed, could realize that
within the life time of the inventor it would be
possible for the farmers of the United States to
raise enough wheat to feed the whole world. Most
people, naturally enough, perhaps, felt as did Miss
Polly Carson when she saw the reaper dragged along
the road on the way to Farmer Ruff's field. Years
later when she told the story of that day she said:</p>

<p>"I thought it a right smart curious sort of
thing, but that it wouldn't amount to much."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>
<p>The successful trial of the reaper was in 1832,
when the United States was about fifty years old. For
the next ten years Cyrus McCormick was preaching
reapers but he did not succeed in selling them.
They seemed very costly to the farmer; and, moreover,
they were not the perfect machines we know
to-day, machines which work as if they had brains
of their own. Not until 1840 was Cyrus McCormick
successful in selling the reapers, which he made
himself at his home. Then he sold two machines
for fifty dollars each. Two years later he sold
seven for one hundred dollars each. Soon he
could sell hundreds.</p>

<p>The West Virginia home was not a good location
for making the reapers as it was both difficult
and expensive, with the poor railroad facilities of
the day, to ship the machines to the great West
where it was already plain that the largest number
would be used. Accordingly Cyrus McCormick
moved nearer his best market, establishing himself
first in Cincinnati, but two years later, in 1847,
choosing the very new, very muddy, very unattractive
little town which has since become the immense
city of Chicago. History has shown the wisdom of
his choice. Chicago soon became the greatest
distributing center of the West, and as the reaper
was necessary to work successfully the big wheat
fields, it was no uncommon sight as early as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>sixties to see, moving out from Chicago, a whole
train loaded with nothing but showy bright-red
reapers.</p>

<small>As advertised in <i>The Working Farmer</i>, 1852. Notice that a man rides

</div>




<p>During the ten years while Cyrus McCormick
was struggling to introduce his reaper, Ezra Harding
grew to admire more and more the tall, handsome,
powerful man who never lost his courage.
Ezra believed in reapers almost as fully as did Mr.
McCormick himself; and when Mr. McCormick
moved to Chicago, Ezra followed him to help make
the wonderful machines.</p>

<p>In the years between the first successful trial
and the time when Ezra went to Chicago so many
changes had been made in the reaper that Miss
Polly Carson would hardly have recognized it, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>she seen it coming down the road. When the machine
was tried in Farmer Ruff's field the grain was
cut by a cutting bar similar to that on a mowing
machine, then it was caught by a reel and carried
to a platform from which it was raked to be tied in
bundles. Two men were needed with each machine;
one walked beside the horses to drive them, the
other walked beside the platform to rake off the
wheat for the bundling. Not very long afterward
Mr. McCormick added seats for both driver and
raker. One of the next big changes was to take
off the raker and his seat and put in their place
an "iron man." This was really a long iron finger
moved by the turning wheels, which did the work
of the raker, and automatically pushed off the cut
grain in untied bundles.</p>

<p>Tying, or binding, the bundles remained for
years the hardest part of the harvesting. It was
the custom to tie the sheaves with a crude rope
made of the grain. This hard, back-breaking
work required both strength and skill and could be
endured only by the strongest men. Even Ezra
Harding said:</p>

<p>"No genius will ever live who can make a machine
throw a cord around a bundle of wheat and
knot that cord securely."</p>

<p>In this, however, Ezra was wrong, for within
twenty-five years from the time when the first
reapers were sold Ezra saw added to the machine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>two steel arms which, driven by the revolution of
the wheels, caught each bundle of grain before it
left the platform on which it was collected, whirled
a wire tight around it, fastened the two ends together
with a twist, cut it loose, and tossed it on
the ground.</p>

<p>There was then only one complaint made by the
farmers. When the grain was fed to cattle they were
often injured by pieces of wire. This trouble was
remedied later by substituting twine for wire, adding
a very ingenious contrivance for knotting the
twine, and then the McCormick Reaper and Self-Binder
might be said to be perfected.</p>

<p>One man alone, to drive the reaper, could then
do what, only twenty years before, had required
twenty men. Moreover, the harvesting of a bushel
of wheat which required under the slow snip, snip
of a sickle three hours could be done in ten minutes!
Long before Ezra Harding was an old man he saw
moving out of the Chicago freight yards a train
loaded with nothing but reapers, carrying these
machines not only over the United States but even
to Russia and China. He saw the wheat crop of
this country doubled and trebled and quadrupled;
he saw the time when even a poor man could have
white bread to eat, because the cost of a loaf had
been cut in two; he saw the reaper bring millions
and millions of dollars to its inventor; and he saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>not only this great wealth come to the man he
himself had long admired, but also, while Cyrus
McCormick was still in the prime of life, the honor
and fame which have been denied many of the
great inventors until after death.</p>

<h2><a name="GRANDMAS_INTRODUCTION_TO" id="GRANDMAS_INTRODUCTION_TO">GRANDMA'S INTRODUCTION TO
ELECTRIC CARS</a></h2>


<p>In 1891 when Harriet Lewis wrote just before
her grandmother's annual visit:</p>

<p>"We have something in Portland this year that
really will surprise you, Grandma," all the family
laughed over her grandmother's answer.</p>

<p>"If you mean the electric cars which I have been
reading about in the <i>Press</i>," so her grandmother's
letter ran, "remember that I have already seen
street cars running up and down hill in San Francisco
without any horses to draw them, and that it
won't be any more surprising to see them running
all alone in Portland, even if it is electricity this
time which makes them go."</p>

<p>"Can't astonish Grandma, can we?" said Harriet's
father, smiling.</p>

<p>It certainly was hard to do so. Grandma had
always been a traveler. She was born in Bath,
Maine, in the days when Maine was famous for
its ship building, and Maine sailing vessels went
all around the world. Her father had been a sea
captain and Grandma had been to China with him
before she was eighteen; her husband also had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>a sea captain and she had been around the world
twice with him. Grandma had seen so much and
was always so interested in what was going on in
the world that when she went to Portland to visit
her oldest son the family there used to say jokingly:</p>

<p>"We must find something new to show Grandma
or she won't feel that she has been anywhere."</p>

<p>They had all expected Grandma to think it as
wonderful as they did that electricity could take
the place of horses, and had expected her to be
very anxious to see the new cars of which so much
had been written. Evidently she did not think
them very much ahead of the cable cars.</p>

<p>"Don't be disappointed, Harriet," said Mr.
Lewis to his little ten-year old daughter, who was
Grandma's namesake. "Wait until Grandma has
seen the new cars; perhaps then she will think it
as marvelous as we do that electricity can be harnessed
to make these cars slide along the rails. She
never has believed that electric cars would be a
success."</p>

<p>"I remember last year when she was here,"
said Harriet's mother, turning to the little girl's
father, "how she used to say, 'I don't like horse
cars on these Maine hills. You ought to have
cable cars. They are the only proper things for
hills!' and how you used to say, 'Wait until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>next year, Mother, and you shall see something
better than cable cars.'"</p>

<p>"She always answered, I recall," added Mr.
Lewis, "'John, never in my lifetime or yours will
electricity be anything but a mystery and a danger.
It may be used to some extent for lighting, but,
mark my words, it can never be made to run heavily
loaded cars. It is too absurd to consider.'"</p>

<p>When Grandma reached Portland, Harriet and
her father met her at the station, and drove her
home behind steady old Prince, who had drawn the
family carriage for years. As they jogged along on
the way to the house they met an electric car.</p>

<p>"I really don't see why it should go, but it is
plain that it does go. If they keep on going for another
twenty-four hours, I am going to have a ride
in one to-morrow morning," said Grandma.</p>

<p>"Oh Mother, Mother!" exclaimed the son.
"You do like to try new things, don't you? Here
I drove Prince to the station just so that you
wouldn't have to ride in one of these cars until
you became used to seeing them slide along driven
by what you call that dangerous fluid."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going to ride once anyway. I've
always tried all the different ways of getting about
that I could. Why, I was the very first person
from our town to ride in a street car in Boston.
That was way back in 1856 in a little bobbing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>horse car drawn by two horses harnessed tandem.
Lots of people then made fun of the little cars, I
remember. They said the omnibus was better.
They used to have races between car and omnibus
sometimes to prove which was better. How the
passengers on the one ahead would cheer! In the
spring, when the snow was going off, the omnibus,
which would still be on runners, would get stuck
in the mud and the car would win; in the winter,
if there was drifting snow, the car would get stuck
and the omnibus would go gliding by with sleigh
bells ringing and passengers waving their hands.
Oh, it was quite exciting, but the omnibuses were
not used a great while after the cars were introduced,
as the cars were really more comfortable, more convenient,
and could make better time."</p>

<p>Several times during the first day of her visit
Grandma exclaimed, "I am thankful not to see any
poor horses straining to draw those cars!"</p>

<p>Pity for the horses had always interfered with
Grandma's enjoyment in riding on the horse cars.
When she and Harriet had been on their accustomed
rides, Harriet always had taken pains to tell when a
third horse was added to the usual pair to help
draw a car up a hill.</p>

<p>"Now he's on, Grandma," she would say when the
car stopped at the foot of a hard hill and a boy
brought up the horse which had been waiting there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>and hooked the heavy tugs to the whiffletree bar
so that the third horse could run along beside the
others, although just outside the rails. "It's a
big horse," she would often add.</p>

<p>But even this had not satisfied Grandma. She
had been in San Francisco when the cable cars
were first put in use and she believed them the only
car suitable for a hilly city.</p>

<p>"You ought to have the cable cars," she had
said many a time. However, before she had
watched the electric cars a half day Grandma went
so far as to say, "If you could be sure there would
be no danger from electricity and be sure of power
enough I don't know why these wouldn't do just
as well as the cable cars."</p>

<p>"Tell me about the cable cars, won't you,
Grandma? What makes them go?" asked Harriet,
now old enough to be interested in the difference
between the systems.</p>

<p>"The cable makes them go," answered her grandmother.
"It is an endless iron chain which the
engine at the central station keeps running all the
time. It travels between the rails in an open channel
or groove just below ground. The car is carried
along by being fastened to this cable. What is it
you call the driver of your new cars&mdash;a motorman?
The man who drives a cable car is called a
gripman. It is his business to work the 'grip,' a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>stout iron contrivance which must catch hold of the
cable when the car is to be carried along and must
be loosened when the car is to be stopped."</p>

<p>"Is San Francisco the only city where they have
those cars?" asked Harriet.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," answered Grandma. "They have
them now in several of the other large cities. San
Francisco was the first city to have them. The
hills there are so steep that it was out of the question
to use horses. Something had to be invented,
and Andrew S. Hallidie planned this system which
has been used successfully ever since 1873."</p>

<p>"Weren't there any people in those days who
thought the cable cars were dangerous, Mother?"
asked Harriet's father slyly.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me, yes," replied his mother. "The
gripman himself lost his courage, I remember, on
one of the very first trips and stopped his car at the
top of his first steep hill. He got off the car and
said that, as he had a wife and children, he did not
think it would be right for him to take the car
down such a hill. The passengers said it was not
a case of right or wrong but a case of being scared,
and they insisted upon his getting on again and
taking them to their journey's end."</p>

<p>"There goes another electric car, Grandma!"
said Harriet who was looking out the window. "It
goes a good deal faster than a horse car, doesn't it?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>
<p>"I should think it did," answered Grandma,
"In contrast with travel on horse cars, going as
fast as that must seem like flying. How can it be
possible to get power enough to drive a big car
like that!"</p>

<p>"It comes right along that overhead wire," answered
Harriet's father.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know that from what I have read,"
continued Grandma. "And it is conducted to
the car along that long iron rod which runs from
the overhead wire to the car. What is it you call
that?"</p>

<p>"The trolley," said Mr. Lewis.</p>

<p>"Then what really happens after the electricity
has reached the car?"</p>

<p>"This current of electricity runs to those
cylinders in front of the motorman. Then it
is where it can be controlled. By the turning
of a crank the motorman can turn on the power
to start the motor and drive the car ahead, or he
can shut it off and make the car stand still. Just
as steam power turns the wheels of the locomotive,
so electric power turns the wheels of
these cars."</p>

<p>"It is very mysterious after all," said Grandma.</p>

<p>"It certainly is," assented her son. "Oliver
Wendell Holmes says it is like witchcraft. Have
you read his poem which says:</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">'Since then on many a car you'll see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A broomstick, plain as plain can be;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On every stick there's a witch astride&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The string, you see, to her leg is tied!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Grandma and Harriet laughed.</p>

<p>"How fast are these cars going?" asked Grandma.</p>

<p>"About ten miles an hour including the stops.
Probably the rate without stops is about fifteen
miles," answered Mr. Lewis.</p>

<p>"There never could be power enough in electricity
to drive the car much faster than that, I suppose?"
said Grandma.</p>

<p>"Yes, they have already gone considerably
faster," replied her son. "I was reading only last
night that back in 1880 when Thomas Edison first
began his experiments with electricity as a motive
power on his own private track at Menlo Park, he
drove his little electric train more than twice as
fast. In June 1880, Grosvenor Lowry wrote, 'Have
spent part of a day at Menlo, and all is glorious.
I have ridden at forty miles an hour on Mr. Edison's
electric railway&mdash;and we ran off the track.'"</p>

<p>"It is dangerous after all, isn't it?" commented
Grandma.</p>

<p>"Most people do not think so. That was when
they were experimenting and of course accidents
were bound to happen. In the three years since
Richmond introduced the system of electric cars
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>more than a hundred other cities have introduced
it; and a hundred more are putting it in, I suppose,
at this present moment."</p>

<p>"We'll ride to-morrow in one of the new cars,
Harriet," said Grandma.</p>

<p>"Goody," said Harriet, "I love to ride in them.
I'd like to ride on Mr. Edison's own electric railway,
and go forty miles an hour."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt you would, puss," said her father,
"but I think he is not using that at all now. He
considers the electric railway a success and he is
working now on something which his friends say
will make it possible to run a horseless carriage
without the help of either rails or a trolley."</p>

<p>"Oh, surely that never can be, John," said
Grandma.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I should have said the same
thing ten years ago about a horseless street car, I
think. Edison's friends remind us that first it
was the horse without the carriage, then it was the
horse and the carriage, and now they say it is surely
going to be the carriage without the horse. Wonders
do not seem to cease; it may come true."</p>

<p>That night about midnight there was a splintering
crash which Grandma thought was only a short
distance from her window. Something had certainly
happened in the street, but there was no
outcry and all was still again in a few minutes after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>the crash. Grandma could not explain it, but it
did not worry her and she went to sleep again.</p>

<p>Very early in the morning she was wakened again
by unusual noises on her side of the house. Going
to the window she was surprised to see an electric
car across the gutter, stopped apparently in its
course by a broken telegraph pole. How had it
come there? It seemed to have come down the
track on the hill opposite, and then to have come
without any track at all straight across the street
at the foot of the hill until it crashed into the pole.
The front of the car was considerably broken. It
had evidently run into the pole with force enough
to snap that off short and spoil the front of the car.</p>

<p>Grandma watched with interest the crew which
had been sent out to get the injured car back again
on the track and take it to the car barn before
most people were stirring. They had a smaller car
to which they securely fastened the runaway car.
Then the little service car pulled the runaway out
of the gutter, across the street, and on to the track
once more. The last Grandma saw of the wrecked
car it was at the top of the hill still being pulled
along by the other car.</p>

<p>"There's no question of power," said Grandma
to herself. "One small car can run along with a
big car trailing after it as easily as if it were alone.
There is only one question left in my mind, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>is the question of control of the power. To see
a big car right across the gutter surely does not
look as if the power were under control."</p>

<p>At breakfast Grandma told what she had heard
and seen.</p>

<p>"Do you know what made the car run away?"
she asked her son.</p>

<p>"Yes, I went out to the street last night after
the crash and found out. There was just one man
out there and he didn't feel very much like talking,
but he did finally tell me what had happened. The
man I found was the conductor."</p>

<p>"What had become of the motorman? Was he
hurt?" asked Mrs. Lewis quickly.</p>

<p>"Nobody was hurt, and nothing was injured
except the pole, and the front of the car, and the
conductor's feelings. It seems that on the last
trip last evening there was nobody on the car except
the conductor and the motorman, and so,
though it is against the rules, the conductor offered
to let the motorman get off when they reached his
home, and to take the car himself up to the end of
the line and then back a little way to the car barn.
His own home is close by the barn. All went well
until the new driver was reaching the end of the line
just opposite us. Then the trolley slipped off and
the car came to a standstill. The conductor stepped
off to put the trolley back in place, and he easily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>and quickly swung it back where it belonged, when&mdash;Great
Scott!&mdash;the car sailed off and left him!
Went to the end of the rails and then had momentum
enough to roll straight across the street plump
into the pole."</p>

<p>"What made it go?" asked Harriet, completely
mystified.</p>

<p>Harriet was not the only one of those present who
was puzzled, and they all listened very carefully
when Mr. Lewis said, "Because the conductor forgot
to shut off the motor when he left the car. As
there wasn't any power on when he stepped off,
naturally he felt no need of shutting it off, but, unfortunately
for him, there was plenty of power as
soon as the trolley was on again."</p>

<p>Harriet began to laugh.</p>

<p>"I see! I see! How easy it was to start a real
runaway! Nothing to do but to put the trolley on
when everything was right for the car to go ahead."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said her father.</p>

<p>"How surprised that poor conductor must have
felt," said Grandma.</p>

<p>"How mortified he must have felt," said Mamma.</p>

<p>"He must have felt the way I did when I left
the water running and flooded the bathroom," said
Harriet sadly.</p>

<p>"I think he had all those feelings," said Mr.
Lewis, "judging from what he said last night."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well, it proves there's power enough to run a
car even without smooth rails," said Grandma.
"And perhaps it proves it is well controlled if it
runs the car straight ahead even when there is nobody
aboard to drive it."</p>

<p>"I hope this strange introduction to electric
cars won't make any difference about your enjoying
your ride to-day, Mother," said Mr. Lewis.</p>

<p>"Difference? Why should it? There won't be
any more conductors taking the place of motormen
to-day, I know," said Grandma.</p>

<p>"Probably not," replied Mr. Lewis, laughing.</p>

<p>"I'm perfectly satisfied with the way the car behaved,"
said Grandma. "We'll ride and ride to-day,
Harriet."</p>

<p>And ride and ride they surely did. Grandma
liked the motion and she was interested in all the
details of running the car, even in how the whistle
was operated, and how the end of the trolley was
connected to the car.</p>

<p>"My introduction to electric cars may have been
peculiar," said Grandma that night, "but my acquaintance
thus far is entirely satisfactory. I
really think I know how they are run and I shouldn't
wonder if I could run one as well as the conductor
on the car last night."</p>

<p>"If you let the motorman get off and you run the
car for him, you won't get off to put the trolley on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>unless you have shut off the motor, will you, Grandma?"
asked Harriet.</p>

<p>Everybody laughed to think how the car had
run away and left the astonished conductor in the
road unable to stop it; but Grandma said, "Runaways
or no runaways, the electric car is the marvel
of the age. It does not seem as if the mind of man
could devise anything more wonderful than this
harnessing of electricity; but yet it may be that
Harriet will sometime ride in one of the horseless
carriages her father spoke of yesterday. If they
ever do have such things of course they'll be very,
very dangerous, but I do wish"&mdash;and everybody
knew what Grandma was going to wish&mdash;"that I
could have just one ride in one myself."
